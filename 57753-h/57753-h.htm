  <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>Last year Mr. G. Flemwell gave us a very
beautiful volume upon the Alpine Flora, and it
has met with well-deserved success. But the
author is not yet satisfied. He thinks to do
better, and would now make known other pictures—those
of Alpine fields, especially during the
spring months.</p>

<p>Springtime in our Alps is certainly the most
beautiful moment of the year, and the months
of May and June, even to the middle of July,
are the most brilliant of all. It is a season which,
up to the present, we have rather considered as
reserved for us Swiss, who do not much like that
which is somewhat irreverently called <i>l’industrie
des étrangers</i>, and perhaps we shall not be altogether
enchanted to find that the author <i>à la mode</i>
is about to draw the veil from our secrets, open
the lock-gates of our most sacred joys to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
international flood, and sound the clarion to make
known, <i>urbe et orbi</i>, the springtime glory of our
fields. With this one little reservation to calm
the egotistical anxiety which is in me (Mr. Flemwell,
who is my colleague in the Swiss Alpine
Club, knows too well our national character not
to understand the spirit in which we make certain
reservations with regard to this invasion of our
mountains by the cosmopolitan crowd), I wish
to thank the author, and to compliment him upon
this fresh monument which he raises to the glory
of our flowers.</p>

<p>He here presents them under a different aspect,
and shows us the Alpine field, the meadow, the
great green slope as they transform themselves
in springtime. He sings of this rebirth with his
poet-soul, and presents it in pictures which are
so many hymns to the glory of the Creator. And
he is justified in this, for nothing in the world
is more marvellous than the re-flowering of Alpine
fields in May and June. I have seen it in the
little <i>vallons</i> of Fully and of Tourtemagne in
Valais, in the fields of Anzeindaz and of Taveyannaz
(Canton de Vaud), at the summit of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Gemmi and on the Oberalp in the Grisons; I
have seen the flowering spring in the Bernese
Oberland and on the Utli (Zurich), in the <i>vallons</i>
of Savoie and in those of Dauphiné; I have seen
the metamorphosis of the Val de Bagnes and of
the Bavarian plain, the transformation of the
marvellous valleys of Piémont and of the elevated
valley of Aosta. But I have never seen anything
more beautiful or more solemn than spring in the
Jura Mountains of Vaud and Neuchatel, with their
fields of <i>Anemone alpina</i> and <i>narcissiflora</i>, when
immense areas disappeared under a deep azure
veil of <i>Gentiana verna</i> or of the darker <i>Gentiana
Clusii</i>, and when the landscape is animated by
myriads of <i>Viola biflora</i> or of Soldanella. In
reading what Mr. Flemwell has written, my spirit
floats further afield even than this—to the Val
del Faene, which reposes near to the Bernina,
and I see over again a picture that no painter,
not even our author, could render: the snow,
in retiring to the heights, gave place to a carpet
of violet, blue, lilac, yellow, or bright pink,
according as it was composed of either <i>Soldanella
pusilla</i>, of long, narrow, pendent bells, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
flowered in thousands and millions upon slopes
still brown from the rigours of winter, or <i>Gentiana
verna</i>, or <i>Primula integrifolia</i>, whose dense masses
were covered with their lovely blossoms, or <i>Gagea
Liotardi</i>, whose brilliant yellow stars shone on
all sides in the sun, or <i>Primula hirsuta</i>.  All
these separate masses formed together a truly
enchanting picture, which remained unadmired by
strangers—since these had not yet arrived—and
which I was happy and proud to salute under
the sky of the Grisons.</p>

<p>Our author seems to have a predilection for
the blue flower of <i>Gentiana verna</i>, and I thank
him for all he says of my favourite. When,
at the age of ten years, I saw it for the first time,
carpeting the fields of the Jura in Vaud, my
child’s soul was so enthusiastic over it that there
were fears I should make myself ill. This impression,
which dates from 1864, is still as fresh
in my memory as if it were of yesterday. Blue,
true blue, is so rare in Nature that Alphonse Karr
could cite but five or six flowers that were really
so: the Gentian, the Comellina, several Delphiniums,
the Cornflower, and the Forget-me-not.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
The blue of the Gentian is certainly the most
superb and velvety, especially that of <i>Gentiana
bavarica</i>.  A group of <i>Gentiana verna</i>, <i>brachyphylla</i>,
and <i>bavarica</i> which I exhibited at the
Temple Show in London in May 1910, and which
was a very modest one, it having suffered during
the long voyage from Floraire to London, was
greatly admired, and did not cease to attract the
regard of all flower-lovers. Blue is so scarce,
every one said, that it is good to feast one’s eyes
upon it when one meets with it!</p>

<p>The practical side of this volume resides in the
information it offers to lovers of Alpine flowers
in England. One readily believes that, in order
to cultivate these mountain plants, big surroundings
are necessary: a great collection of rocks,
as in the giant Alpine garden of Friar Park. We
have proved in our garden of Floraire—where
the public is willingly admitted, and which flower-lovers
are invited to visit—that mountain plants
can be cultivated without rockwork, and that it
is even important, if one wishes to give an artistic
and natural aspect to the garden, not to be too
prodigal of rock and stone.  Much verdure is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
essential, it is necessary to have a frame for the
picture, and that frame can only be obtained by
creating the Alpine field. One day at Friar Park,
Sir Frank Crisp, the creator of this beautiful
<i>alpinum</i>, taking me aside and making me walk
around with him, showed me a vast, empty
field which stretched away to the north of the
Matterhorn, and said: “It is here that I wish
to establish a Swiss field to soften the too rocky
aspect of the garden and to give it a fitting frame.”
And since then I am unable to conceive that there
was ever a time when the Alpine garden at Friar
Park had not its setting of Alpine fields. There
was no idea of making such a thing when the
garden was begun; but once the rockwork was
finished the rest imposed itself. One needs the
flower-filled field, <i>l’alpe en fête</i>, by the side of the
grey rocks.</p>

<p>This is why, in our horticultural establishment
at Floraire, we make constant efforts to reproduce
expanses of Narcissi, Columbines, Gentians,
Daphnes, Primulas, etc., grouped in masses as we
have seen them in nature, and as Mr. Flemwell
gives them in his book.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>
<p>Herein lies the great utility of this volume,
and the reason why it will be consulted with
pleasure by gardeners as well as by alpinists and
lovers of nature generally.</p>

<p class="ac">OF OUR ENTHUSIASM FOR “ALPINES”</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“We are here dealing with one of the strongest intellectual impulses
of rational beings. Animals, as a rule, trouble themselves but
little about anything unless they want either to eat it or to run away
from it. Interest in, and wonder at, the works of nature and of the
doings of man are products of civilisation, and excite emotions which
do not diminish, but increase with increasing knowledge and cultivation.
Feed them and they grow; minister to them and they will
greatly multiply.”—THE RT. HON. A. J. BALFOUR, <i>in his Address
as Lord Rector of St. Andrews University, December 10, 1887</i>.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Some</span> excuse—or rather, some explanation—seems
to be needed for daring to present yet
another book upon the Alpine Flora of Switzerland.
So formidable is the array of such books already,
and so persistently do additions appear, that it is
not without diffidence that I venture to swell the
numbers, and, incidentally, help to fill the new
subterranean chamber of the Bodleian.</p>

<p>With the author of “Du Vrai, Du Beau, et
Du Bien,” I feel that “Moins la musique fait de
bruit et plus elle touche”; I feel that reticence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
rather than garrulity is at the base of well-being,
and that, if the best interests of the cult of
Alpines be studied, any over-production of books
upon the subject should be avoided, otherwise we
are likely to be face to face with the danger of
driving this particular section of the plant-world
within that zone of appreciation “over which hangs
the veil of familiarity.”</p>

<p>Few acts are more injudicious, more unkind,
or more destructive than that of overloading.
“The last straw” will break the back of anything,
not alone of a camel. One who is
mindful of this truth is in an anxious position
when he finds himself one of a thousand
industrious builders busily bent upon adding
straw upon straw to the back of one special
subject.</p>

<p>It were a thousand pities if, for want of
moderation, Alpines should go the way Sweet Peas
are possibly doomed to go—the way of all overridden
enthusiasms. Extravagant attention is no
new menace to the welfare of that we set out
to admire and to cherish, and it were pity of pities
if, for lack of seemly restraint, the shy and lovely
denizens of the Alps should arrive at that place in
our intimacy where they will no longer be generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
regarded with thoughtful respect and intelligent
wonder, but will be obliged to retire into the
oblivion which so much surrounds those things
immediately and continuously under our noses.
For, of all plants, they merit to be of our abiding
treasures.</p>

<p>But just because we have come to the opinion
that Alpines stand in need of less “bush,” it does
not necessarily follow that we must be sparing
of our attention. There is ample occasion for an
extension of honest, balanced intimacy. What we
have to fear is an irrational freak-enthusiasm
similar to the seventeenth-century craze for Tulips—a
craze of which La Bruyère so trenchantly
speaks in referring to an acquaintance who was
swept off his feet by the monstrous prevailing
wave. “God and Nature,” he says, “are not
in his thoughts, for they do not go beyond the
bulb of his tulip, which he would not sell for a
thousand pounds, though he will give it you for
nothing when tulips are no longer in fashion,
and carnations are all the rage. This rational
being, who has a soul and professes some religion,
comes home tired and half starved, but very
pleased with his day’s work. He has seen some
tulips.”  Now this was enthusiasm of a degree
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and kind which could not possibly endure; reaction
was bound to come. Of course, it was an extreme
instance of fashion run mad, and one of which
Alpines may never perhaps provoke a repetition.
Yet we shall do well to see a warning in it.</p>

<p>I think I hear enthusiastic lovers of Alpines
protesting that there is no fear whatever of such
an eventuality for their gems, because these latter
are above all praises and attentions and cannot be
overrated. I fancy I hear the enthusiasts explaining
that Alpines are not Sweet Peas, or Tulips, or
double Show Dahlias; that they occupy a place
apart, a place such as is occupied by the hot-house
and greenhouse Orchids, a place unique and unassailable.
And these protestations may quite
possibly prove correct; I only say that, in view of
precedents, there lurks a tendency towards the
danger named, and that it therefore behoves all
those who have the solid welfare of these plants
at heart to be on their guard, to discourage mere
empty attentions, and to do what is possible to
direct enthusiasm into sound, intelligent channels.
“An ignorant worship is a poor substitute for a
just appreciation.” Aye, but it is often more than
this; it is often a dangerous one.</p>

<p>Already the admiration and attention meted out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
to Alpines is being spoken of as a fashion, a rage,
and a craze; and we know that there is no smoke
without fire. Certainly, the same language has
been used towards the enthusiasm shown for
Orchids. But Orchids have nought to fear from
that degree of popularisation which impinges upon
vulgarisation. The prices they command and the
expense attendant upon their culture afford them
important protection—a protection which Alpines
do not possess to anything like the same extent.</p>

<p>Of course, the fate in store for Alpines in
England is not of so inevitable a nature as that
awaiting Japanese gardening; for in this latter
“craze” there is an element scarcely present in
Alpine gardening. We can more or less fathom
the spirit of Alpine gardening and are therefore
quite able to construct something that shall be
more or less intelligent and true; but can we say
as much for ourselves with regard to Japanese
gardening? I think not. I think that largely it
is, and must remain, a sealed book to us. Japanese
gardening, as Miss Du Cane very truly points out
in her Preface to “The Flowers and Gardens of
Japan,” is “the most complicated form of gardening
in the world.” Who in England will master
the “seven schools” and absorb all the philosophy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and subtle doctrine which governs them? Who
in England will bring himself to see a rock, a pool,
a bush as the Japanese gardener sees them, as,
indeed, the Japanese people in general see them?
The spirit of Japanese gardening is as fundamentally
different from the spirit of English gardening as that
of Japanese art is from English art. What poor,
spiritless results we have when English art assumes
the guise of Japanese art! It is imitation limping
leagues behind its model. And it is this because
it is unthought, unfelt, unrealized.</p>

<p>Strikingly individual, the Japanese outlook is
much more impersonal than is ours. Needs
must that we be born into the traditions of
such a race to comprehend and feel as it does
about Nature. A Japanese must have his rocks,
streams, trees proportioned to his tea or dwelling
house and bearing mystic religious significance.
Such particular strictness is the product of ages of
upbringing. A few years, a generation or two
could not produce in us the reasoned nicety of this
phase of appreciation; still less the reading of
some book or the visit to some garden built by
Japanese hands. The spirit of a race is of far
longer weaving; one summer does not make a
butterfly;</p>

<p>To us a tiny chalet is quite well placed amid
stupendous cliffs and huge, tumbled boulders, and
is fit example to follow, if only we are able to do
so. In Alpine gardening we feel no need to study
the size of our rocks in relation to our summer-house,
or place them so that they express some
high philosophic or mystic principle. We have no
cult beyond Nature’s own cult in this matter.
We see, and we are content to see, that Nature
has no nice plan and yet is invariably admirable;
we see, and we are content to see, that if man, as
in Switzerland, chooses to plant his insignificant
dwelling in the midst of great, disorderly rocks
and crowded acres of brilliant blossoms, it is
romantic garden enough and worthy of as close
imitation as possible.</p>

<p>With the Japanese, gardening is perhaps more
a deeply æsthetic culture than it is the culture of
plants. Where we are bald, unemotional, “scientific”
gardeners, they will soar high into the clouds
of philosophic mysticism. Truer children of the
Cosmos than we Western materialists, they walk
in their gardens as in some religious rite. We, too,
no doubt, are often dreamers; we, too, are often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wont to find in our gardens expression for our
searching inner-consciousness; but how different
are our methods, how different the spirit we wish
to express.</p>

<p>The most, therefore, we can accomplish in
Japanese modes of gardening is to ape them; and
of this, because of its emptiness, we shall very
soon tire. The things which are most enduring
are the things honestly felt and thought; for the
expression of the true self reaches out nearest to
satisfaction. Unless, then, we are apes in more
than ancestry, Japanese gardening can have no
long life among us. Alpine gardening is far more
akin to our natural or hereditary instincts; it holds
for us the possibility of an easier and more honest
appreciation. And it is just here, in this very fact,
where lies much of the danger which may overtake
and smother the immense and growing enthusiasm
with which Alpines are meeting.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>How best, then, to direct and build up this
enthusiasm into something substantial, something
that shall secure for Alpines a lasting place in our
affections? The answer is in another question:
What better than a larger, more comprehensive
appeal to Alpine nature; what better than a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
thorough translation of Alpine circumstance to
our grounds and gardens?</p>

<p>Now, to this end we must look around us in the
Alps to find that element in plant-life which we
have hitherto neglected; and if we do this, our
eyes must undoubtedly alight upon the fields.
Hitherto these have been a greatly neglected
quantity with us when planning our Alpine
gardens, and their possibilities have been almost
entirely overlooked in respect of our home-lands.
Why should we not make more pronounced attempts
to create such meadows, either as befitting
adjuncts to our rock works or as embellishments to
our parks? I venture to think that such an extension
and direction of our enthusiasm would add
much sterling popularity to that already acquired
by Alpines in our midst, besides doing far greater
justice to many of their number. I venture to
think, also, that it would add much to the joy and
health of home-life. These thoughts, therefore,
shall be developed and examined as we push forward
with this volume, first of all making a careful
study of the fields on the spot, and marking their
“moods and tenses.”</p>

<p>“If you go to the open field, you shall always be in contact directly
with the Nature. You hear how sweetly those innocent birds are
singing. You see how beautifully those meadow-flowers are blossoming....
Everything you are observing there is pure and sacred.
And you yourselves are unconsciously converted into purity by the
Nature.”—YOSHIO MARKINO, <i>My Idealed John Bulless</i>.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Alpine Flower-fields</span>;
it is well that we should
at once come to some understanding as to the
term “Alpine” and what it is here intended to
convey, otherwise it will be open to misinterpretation.
Purists in the use of words will be nearer
to our present meaning than they who have in
mind the modern and general acceptation of the
words “Alp” and “Alpine.” The authority of
custom has confirmed these words in what, really,
is faulty usage. “Alp” really means a mountain
pasturage, and its original use, traceable for more
than a thousand years, relates to any part of a
mountain where the cattle can graze. It does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
not mean merely the snow-clad summit of some
important mountain. Nor does “Alpine” mean
that region of a mountain which is above the
tree-limit.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i045.jpg" id="i045.jpg"></a>

        alt="" width="438" height="600" />
  <div class="caption">The UPPER FIELDS of Champex early in June,
    with the Grand Combin in the distance.</div>
</div>

<p>Strictly, then, Alpine circumstance is circumstance
surrounding the mountain pasturages,
whether these latter be known popularly as Alpine
or as sub-Alpine. To the popular mind—to-day
to a great extent amongst even the Swiss themselves—Alpine
heights at once suggest what Mr.
E. F. Benson calls “white altitudes”; but that
should not be the suggestion conveyed here. For
present purposes it should be clearly understood
that the term “Alpine pastures” is used in its
old, embracive sense, and that sub-Alpine pastures
are included and, indeed, predominate.</p>

<p>Of course, we may be obliged to bow occasionally
to a custom that has so obliterated
original meanings, or we shall risk becoming unintelligible;
we may from time to time be obliged
to use the word “sub-Alpine” for the lower sphere
in Alpine circumstance (although, really and truly,
the word should suggest circumstance removed
from off the Alps—circumstance purely and simply
of the plains). We shall therefore do well to
accept the definition of “sub-Alpine” given by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Dr. Percy Groom in the “General Introduction to
Ball’s Alpine Guide,”—“the region of coniferous
trees.” Yet, at the same time, it must be clearly
understood that our use of the term “Alpine”
embraces this sub-Alpine region.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary to start with this
understanding, because, in talking here—or, for
that matter, anywhere—of Alpine plants we shall
be talking much of sub-Alpine plants. After all,
our own gardens warrant this. Our Alpine
rockeries are, in point of fact, very largely sub-Alpine
with regard to the plants which find a
place upon them. As laid down in the present
writer’s “Alpine Flowers and Gardens,” it is difficult,
if not impossible, to draw any definite line, even
for the strictest of Alpine rock-gardening, between
Alpines and sub-Alpines. The list would indeed
be shorn and abbreviated which would exclude
all subjects not found solely above the pine-limit.
A ban would have to be placed upon the best
of the Gentians, the two Astrantias, the Paradise
and the Martagon Lily, to mention nothing of
Campanulas, Pinks, Geraniums, Phyteumas, Saxifrages,
Hieraciums, and a whole host of other
precious and distinctive blossoms. It would never
do; our rockworks would be robbed of their best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and brightest. Therefore, because there is much
that is Alpine in sub-Alpine vegetation (just as
there is much that is sub-Alpine in Alpine vegetation)
we must, at any rate for the purposes of
this volume, adhere to the etymology of the word
“Alpine,” and give the name without a murmur
to the middle and lower mountain-fields, in precisely
the same spirit in which we give the name
to our mixed rockworks in England.</p>

<p>No need for us to travel higher than from
4,000 to 5,000 feet (and we may reasonably descend
to some 3,000 or 2,500 feet). No need
whatever to scramble to the high summer pastures
on peak and col (6,000 to 7,000 feet), where
abound “Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal
frost”; where, around a pile of stones or <i>signal</i>,
solitary Swallow-tail butterflies love to disport
themselves; where the sturdy cowherd invokes in
song his patron-saint, St. Wendelin; and where
the pensive cattle browse and chew the cud for
a brief and ideal spell. No need to seek, for
instance, the rapid pastures around the summit of
Mount Cray, or on the steep col between the
Gummfluh and the Rubly, if we are at Château
d’Oex; or to toil to the Col de Balme or to the
“look-out” on the Arpille, if we are at the Col
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
de la Forclaz; or to scale the Pas d’Encel or the
Col de Coux, if we are at Champéry; or to
clamber to the Croix de Javernaz, if we are at
Les Plans; or to follow the hot way up to the
Col de la Gueulaz, if we are at Finhaut; or to
take train to the grazing-grounds on the summit
of the Rochers de Naye, if we are at Caux or at
Les Avants. We shall find all we desire—as at
Randa, Zermatt, Binn, Bérisal, or Evolena—within
a saunter of the hotels. Such fields as are above
are, for the far greater part, used solely for grazing,
and we must stay where most are reserved for
hay. Here we shall find the particular flora we
require, and shall be able to study it without let
or hindrance from “the tooth of the goat” and
cow. The only hindrance will be when those
strict utilitarians, the haymakers, appear and
change our colour-full Eden into a green and
park-like domain, with here and there a neglected
corner to remind us of what a rich prospect was
ours—</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Thus, we are to remain in a region comfortably
accessible to the average easy-going visitor to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Alps—the region in which so well-found a place
as Lac Champex is situated.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i053.jpg" id="i053.jpg"></a>

  <div class="caption"><i>TROLLIUS EUROPÆUS</i>, the Globe Flower,

  </div>
</div>


<p>And what a wondrous region it is, this which
is of sufficient altitude for Nature to be thrown
right out of what, in the plains, is her normal habit;
where the Cherry-tree, if planted, blooms only
about the middle of June; where the Eglantine
is in full splendour in the middle of July and can
be gathered well into August; where the blackbird
is still piping at the end of July; where the
wild Laburnum is in blossom in August; and
where quantities of ripe fruit of the wild Currant,
Raspberry, and Strawberry may be picked in
September.</p>

<p>And Champex, too, what a favoured and beautiful
place! I have chosen this particular spot as
the “base of operations,” because of its variety in
physical aspect, and, consequently, its variety in
flowers. This plan I have deemed of more use
than to wander from place to place, and I think
that, on the whole, it will be fair to the Swiss
Alpine field-flora. We can take note from time
to time of what is not to be found here; for, of
course, Champex does not possess all the varieties
of Alpine field-flowers. <i>Lilium croceum</i>, <i>Anemone
alpina</i>, <i>Narcissus poeticus</i>, and the Daffodil are,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
for instance, notable absentees. The soil is granitic
rather than calcareous. Yet, taking all in all, the
flora is wonderfully representative; and it certainly
is exceptionally rich.</p>

<p>Situated upon what is really a broad, roomy
col between the Catogne and that extreme western
portion of the Mont Blanc <i>massif</i> containing the
Aiguille du Tour and the Pointe d’Orny, Champex,
with its sparkling lake and cluster of hotels and
châlets, dominates to the south the valleys of
Ferret and Entremont, and to the north the valley
of the Dranse, thus offering rich, well-watered
pasture-slopes of varied aspect and capacity.
Whether it be upon the undulating pastures
falling away to the Gorges du Durnand, or upon
the steeper fields leading down to Praz-de-Fort
and Orsières, 1,000 and 2,000 feet below; or
whether it be upon the luxuriant, marshy meadows
immediately around the lake, or upon the slightly
higher, juicy grass-land of the wild and picturesque
Val d’Arpette, there is an ever-changing and
gorgeous luxury of colour which must be seen
to be believed. “The world’s a-flower,” and a-flower
without one single trace of sameness.
Whichever way we walk, whichever way we gaze,
the eye meets with some fresh combination of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
tints, some new and arresting congregation of field-flowers.</p>

<p>It is too much, perhaps, to say of any place that
it is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“The only point where human bliss stands still,</div>
       <div class="verse">And tastes the good without the fall to ill.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But if such eulogy ever were permissible it would
be so of Champex and her flower-strewn fields
and slopes in May and June and early in July.
In any case, we may unquestionably allow ourselves
to quote further of Pope’s lines and say that, amid
these fields, if anywhere, we are able to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Grasp the whole world of reason, life, and sense,</div>
       <div class="verse">In one close system of benevolence.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Like Elizabeth of “German Garden” fame, we
English love, and justly love, our “world of
dandelions and delights.” We find our meadows
transcend all others, and, in them—still like
Elizabeth—we “forget the very existence of everything
but ... the glad blowing of the wind across
the joyous fields.” But in this pride there is room,
I feel sure, for welcome revelation. I can imagine
few things that would more increase delight in a
person familiar only with English meadows than
to be suddenly set down among the fields of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Alps in either May, or June, or early July. What
would he, or she, then feel about “the glad blowing
of the wind across the joyous fields”? It would
surely entail a very lively state of ecstasy.</p>

<p>And if only we had at home these grass-lands
of Champex! Such hayfields in England would
create a furore. Hourly excursions would be run
to where they might be found. Lovers of the beautiful
would be amazed, then overjoyed, and lost
in admiration. Farmers, too, would likewise be
amazed—then look askance and rave about “bad
farming.” Undoubtedly there would be a war of
interests. Upon which side would be the greater
righteousness, it is not easy to decide; but presently
we shall have occasion to look into the matter
more closely. In the meantime, no particular
daring is required to predict that, if these meadows
came to our parks and gardens, they would come
to stay.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span>
is essential that we arrive amid the Alpine
fields in May; for we must watch them from the
very beginning. To postpone our coming until
June would be to miss what is amongst the
primest of Alpine experiences: the awakening of
the earlier gems in their shy yet trustful legions.
Indeed, in June in any ordinary year, we should
risk finding several lovely plants gone entirely
out of bloom, except perhaps quite sparsely in
some belated snow-clogged corner; for, be it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
remembered, we shall not be climbing higher than
this region: we do not propose to pursue Flora
as she ascends to the topmost pasture. As for
following the very general rule and coming only
in late July, it is quite out of the question. We
must come in May; and it should be towards the
middle of the month—although the exact date
will, of course, be governed by the advanced or
retarded state of the season. Speaking generally,
however, the 15th is usually neither too early nor
too late. It is wiser to be a day or so too early
than otherwise, because at this altitude it is remarkable
how soon Nature is wide awake when
once she has opened her eyes. The earliest floral
effects are of the most fleeting in the Alps; and,
like most things fleeting in this changeful world,
they are of the most lovely. To some it may
appear laughable to say that one day is of vast
importance; but it is only the truth. Down on
the plains things are positively sluggish by comparison
(though an artist, wishing to paint them
at their best, knows only too well how rapid even
are these). As in Greenland, up here, at 4,800
feet, vegetation adapts itself in all practical earnest
to the exigencies of shortened seasons. June’s
glories are quick in passing; so, alas, are July’s;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
but the glories of May, having usually but a brief
portion of the month in which to develop, pass,
as it were, at breathless speed.</p>

<p>Yes, if ever there is a nervous energy of nature,
it is in May in Alpine regions; and it behoves
us to be equally quick and timely. For instance,
this year (1910) I was struck by the fact that, two
weeks after the last vestige of an avalanche had
cleared from off a steep slope at the foot of the
Breyaz, three or four cows belonging to the hotels
were grazing contentedly on rich green grass, and
the Crocus and Soldanella had already bloomed and
disappeared.</p>

<p>When we quit the plains their face is well set
towards June. Spring’s early timidity and delicacy
are past; the Primrose, Scilla, Hepatica, Violet,
and Wood-Anemone have retired into a diligent
obscurity and the fields are already gay with the
Orchids and the Globe-Flower. But up here at
Champex we find ourselves back with the Crocus,
springing fresh and glistening from the brown,
snow-soaked sward, and with the as yet scarcely
awakened Cowslip. As we climb up from Martigny
the slopes grow more and more wintry-looking,
and we may perhaps begin to regret leaving the
wealth of blushing apple-blossom which dominates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the azure-blue fields of Myosotis below the Gorges
du Durnand. And this regret will probably become
more keen when we plunge into the forests
just below Champex and find them still choked
with snow and ice. But we are soon and amply
repaid for what at first seems a mad ostracism
on our part. One or two brief days, full of intense
interest in watching Alpine nature’s unfolding, and
all regrets have vanished, and we have quite decided
that these May fields are a Paradise wherein, in
Meredith’s words, “of all the world you might
imagine gods to sit.”</p>

<p>The Crocus is not for long alone in making
effective display. The Soldanella soon joins it
after a few hours of warm sunshine; in fact, in
many favoured corners it is already out when we
arrive. And <i>Geum montanum</i> is no laggard;
neither are the two Gentians, <i>verna</i> and <i>excisa</i>, nor
the yellow-and-white Box-leaved Polygala. By the
time the 20th of the month has come the pastures
are thickly sown with pristine loveliness, and by
the 25th this is at the height of perfection—a
height to which nothing in paint or in ink can
attain. Flora has touched the fields with her
fairy wand and they have responded with amazing
alacrity. Turn which way we will, the landscape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
is suffused with the freshest of yellow, rose, and
blue; and broad, surprising acres of these bewitching
hues lie at our very door, coming, as it were,</p>

<p class="noindent">Our “laundered bosoms” swell with hymns of
praise; the plains have receded into Memory’s
darker recesses, and we vote these Alpine meadows
to a permanent and foremost place in our affections—so
much so, indeed, that, with Théophile Gautier,
we unhesitatingly declare (though not, be it said,
with quite all the musical exaggeration of his poet
spirit):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Mais, moi, je les préfère aux champs gras et fertiles</div>
       <div class="verse">Qui sont si loin du ciel qu’on n’y voit jamais Dieu.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We know, of course, Divinity is not absent on
the plains. When the poet says otherwise it is
a tuneful licence with which we are merely tolerant.
We quite understand that there is a more moderate
meaning behind his extravagance. We know, and
everybody acquainted with Alpine circumstance
knows, that in the Alps there is a very strong
and striking sense of the nearer presence of the
Divine in nature. There is a superior and indescribable
purity, together with a refinement and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
restraint which defies what is the utmost prodigality
of colour; and, much as we love the divinity of
things in the plains, the divinity of those of high
altitudes must take a foremost position in our
esteem and joy.</p>

<p>Mr. A. F. Mummery has a fine passage touching
this subject—a passage that may well be quoted
here, for it sums up in admirable fashion all that
we ourselves are feeling. “Every step,” he says,
“is health, fun, and frolic. The troubles and cares
of life, together with the essential vulgarity of a
plutocratic society, are left far below—foul miasmas
that cling to the lowest bottoms of reeking
valleys. Above, in the clear air and searching
sunlight, we are afoot with the quiet gods, and
men can know each other and themselves for
what they are.” “The quiet gods”—yes, indeed!
Here, if anywhere, in May and June, is quietness;
here at this season these hosts of lovely flowers
are indeed “born to blush unseen” and, in Man’s
arrogant phrase, to “waste their sweetness on
the desert air.”</p>

<p>But what nonsense it is, this assumption that
the flowers are wasted if not seen by us! It is
not for that reason we should be here: it is not
because the flowers would benefit one iota by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
our presence. What is it to them whether they
have, or have not been seen by Man? “We
are what suns and winds and waters make us,”
they say; and, in saying thus, they speak but
the substantial truth. Their history is one of
strenuous self-endeavour; their unique and dazzling
loveliness they have attained “alone,” oblivious of
Man’s presence in the world. After age-long
effort, from which their remarkable happiness and
beauty are the primest distillations, Man stumbles
upon them in their radiance, declares they are
languishing for want of his admiration, and at once
commiserates with them upon their lone and
wasted lot. What fond presumption! How
typically human!</p>

<p>Is there not proof abundant of Nature’s “profuse
indifference to mankind?” Why, then, should
Man assume that all things are made for him?
why, in his small, lordly way, should he say—as he
is for ever saying—“The sun, the moon, the stars,
have their <i>raison d’être</i> in Me?” In a sense he is
right, but not in the arrogant sense he so much
presumes. All things help to make him. The sun,
moon, and stars are for him, inasmuch as he would
not be what he is—he would not, probably, be
Man—did they not exist. But neither, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
would the black-beetle be as it is. Do not let
him forget the high claims of the black-beetle.</p>

       <div class="verse">That leaves <i>him</i> not on his imagined throne.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Let us be humble: let us merge ourselves
modestly in the scheme of things. It is not to
cheer up the flowers in their “loneliness” that we
ought to be with them here in the spring. We
ought to be here because of all that the flowers
and their loveliness can do for <i>us</i>, in lifting us
above “the essential vulgarity of a plutocratic
society,” and in revealing us to ourselves and to
each other as rarely we are revealed elsewhere.
Here with these pastures are health and vigour—vigour
that is quiet and restful; here is unpretentiousness
more radiant, more glorious, than the
most dazzling of pretensions. Here, if we will, we
can come and be natural—here, where Man, that
“feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and
grievances,” as Mr. Bernard Shaw calls him, can
be in the fullest sense a man, and be in no wise
ashamed of it. For here, in a word, is Nature—unaffected,
unconventional, unconscious of herself,
yet in the highest degree efficient. The purity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
it all is wonderful. And it is this, with its
beneficent power, that <i>we</i> waste.</p>

<p>If spring is reckoned pure below, among “the
foul miasmas that cling to the lowest bottoms of
reeking valleys,” how much purer must it not be
reckoned under Alpine skies! The amelioration
is already marked after we have risen a few
hundred feet from the plains. Our minds climb
with our bodies, both attuning themselves to the
increasing purity of our surroundings, until at some
5,000 feet we feel, to use a homely expression,
as different as chalk from cheese. And
nothing aids more potently in this attunement
than do the fields of springtime blossoms.</p>

<p>“Why bloom’st thou so?” asks the poet of these
flowers—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse indent-1_5">“Why bloom’st thou so</div>
       <div class="verse">In solitary loveliness, more fair</div>
       <div class="verse">In this thy artless beauty, than the rare</div>
       <div class="verse">And costliest garden-plant?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The question has been answered, or, at any rate,
answered in important part, and far more truthfully
than by any blind, patronising remark about
“wasted beauty.” Wasted! It is an accusation
which the flowers should hurl at us! Wasted?
Yes; wasted, in so far as we do not yet take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
advantage of the Alpine spring; wasted, in so
far as we arrive only in late July or early
August!</p>

<p>Nor should our praise be counted amongst
surprises. Champex’s fields bear witness to it
being no mere idle adulation. On the flat damp
grass-land, intersected by sparkling glacier streams,
which stretches away to the north of the lake,
great and brilliant groups of <i>Caltha palustris</i> (only
the common Marsh-Marigold, it is true, but of
how much more luscious, brilliant hue than down
upon some lowland marsh) lie upon a vast rosy
carpet of <i>Primula farinosa</i>, effectively broken here
and there by the rich purple tints of <i>Bartsia alpina</i>
and the ruddier hues of Pedicularis. And this
wondrous wealth of yellow and rose is found again
on the extensive sunny slopes to the south of the
lake; but here <i>Gentiana verna</i> asserts its bright
blue presence amongst the Primula, and the effect
is even more astonishingly gay than it is to the
north. Like Count Smorltorks “poltics,” it
“surprises by himself.”</p>

<p>On these southern slopes, too, are quantities of
Micheli’s Daisy, enlivening still more with their
glistening whiteness the beautiful colour-scheme.
There are also colonies of the two Pinguiculas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
mauve and creamy-white; also of the quaint
Alpine Crowfoot and of the yet more quaint,
æsthetically tinted <i>Ajuga pyramidalis</i>—the most
arresting of the Bugles—and of the demure little
Alpine Polygala, varying from blue (the type)
through mauve to reddish-pink, even to white.
Here, also, is the Sulphur Anemone just unfolding
the earliest of its clear citron-coloured blossoms.
But to see this Anemone to fullest advantage we
must turn to the drier pastures to the east and
north of the lake, where it is scattered in endless
thousands amongst sheets of <i>Gentiana verna</i> and
<i>excisa</i> and a profusion of the yellow Pedicularis
(<i>tuberosa</i>), the white Potentilla (<i>rupestris</i>), the
golden Geum (<i>montanum</i>), the purple Calamintha
(<i>alpina</i>), the canary-yellow Biscutella (<i>lævigata</i>),
the rosy-red Saponaria (<i>ocymoides</i>), and many
another of the earlier pasture-flowers. And by
the side of all this ravishing young life and colour
are the still remaining avalanches of piled-up
frozen snow—grim reminders of what wild riot
winter makes upon these pastures whilst the
flowers are sleeping.</p>

<p>Surely, then our praise is not surprising? Surely,
nowhere in the Alps in May shall we find anything
more admirable or more amazingly colour-full than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
are these pasture-slopes and meadows of Lac
Champex? In some one or other respect their
equal may be found in many favoured places;
in many spots we shall find most astonishing
displays of other kinds of plants than we have
here—of, for instance, the white <i>Anemone alpina</i>
and the purple <i>Viola calcarata</i>, as on the slopes of
the Chamossaire above Villars-sur-Ollon (though
the Viola is in quantity near Champex, in the
Val d’Arpette, in June), or of the Pheasant-eye
Narcissus, as at Les Avants and Château d’Oex,
and the Daffodil, as at Champéry and Saas; but,
taking Champex’s floral wealth as a whole, it
can have few, if any superiors in point of
abundance and colour at this early season.
Mindful of what Mr. Reginald Farrer has said
of Mont Cenis towards the end of June, we may
safely declare that the Viola and Gentian clothed
slopes of that district are not the only slopes in
the Alps which might be “visible for miles away.”</p>

<p>Perhaps some more substantial idea of these
fields at this season may be gathered from the
pictures facing pages iii and 3; but these transcriptions,
though to the uninitiated they may
appear reckless with regard to truth, are really
far from adequate. Seeing the thing itself must,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in this case, alone bring entire belief and understanding.
“Colour, the soul’s bridegroom,” is so
abounding, so fresh, light, joyful, and enslaving,
that, after all has been said and done to picture
it, one sits listless, dejected and despairing
over one’s tame and lifeless efforts; one feels
that it must be left to speak for itself in its own
frank, dreamland language—language at once
both elusive and comprehensible. The soul of
things is possessed of an eloquent and secret code
which is every whit its own; and the soul of
these fields is no exception. In spite of Wordsworth,
there is, and there must be, “need of a
remoter charm”; there is, and there must be,
an “interest unborrowed from the eye”; and it
is just this vague, appealing “something”—this
“something” so real as to transcend what is
known as reality—which speaks to us and invades
us in the bright and intimate presence of these
hosts of Alpine flowers.</p>

<p>In rural parts of England spring is said to
have come when a maiden’s foot can cover seven
daisies at once on the village green. Why, when
spring had come here, on these Alpine meadows,
I was putting my foot (albeit of goodlier proportions
than a maiden’s) upon at least a score
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of Gentians! Whilst painting the study of
Sulphur Anemones (facing page 96) about
May 20, my feet, camp-stool, and easel were
perforce crushing dozens of lovely flowers—flowers
which in England would have been fenced
about with every sort of reverence. But sacrifice
is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>mot d’ordre</i></span> of a live and useful world;
worship at any shrine is accompanied by some
“hard dealing”; and, sadly as it went against
the grain, there was no gentler way in which I
could effect my purpose.</p>

<p>Looking at the close-set masses of blossom, it
is difficult to realise into what these slopes and
fields will develop later on. There seems no room
for a crop of hayfield grass. Amid this neat and
packed abundance there seems no possible footing
for a wealth of greater luxuriance. And yet, in a
few weeks’ time, these fields will have so changed
as to be scarcely recognisable. What we see
at present, despite its ubiquity, is but a moiety
of all they can produce. June and July will
border upon a plethora of wonders, though they
will not perhaps be rivals to the exquisite charm
of May.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Do</span> you ask what the Alps would be without the
Edelweiss? Ask, rather, what they would be
without the little Vernal Gentian! Ask what
would be the slopes and fields of Alpine Switzerland
without this flower of heaven-reflected blue,
rather than what the rocks and screes and uncouth
places would be without <i>Leontopodium
alpinum</i> of bloated and untruthful reputation.
Ask what Alpland’s springtide welcome and
autumnal salutation would be if shorn of this
little plant’s bright azure spontaneity; ask where
would be spring’s eager joyfulness, and where the
ready hopefulness of autumn. Ask yourself this,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and then the Edelweiss at once falls back into
a more becoming perspective with the landscape,
into a less faulty pose among the other mountain
flowers.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not very venturesome to think
that if the Edelweiss had become extinct, and
were now to be found only amid the fastnesses
of legend, it would live quite as securely in the
hearts of men as it does at present; for its repute
rests mostly upon the fabulous. But how different
is the case of the earliest of the Gentians! Here
is a plant which, despite the romance-breeding
nature of its habit, form, and colour, draws little
or nothing from legendary sources. Fable has
small command where merit is so marked; imagination
is outstripped by reality, and there is scarcely
room for invention where truth is so arresting, so
pronounced.</p>

<p><i>Gentiana verna</i> flies no false colours. Its
flower <i>is</i> a flower, and not for the greater part
an assemblage of hoary-haired leaves. It inspires
in men no performance of mad gymnastics on the
precipice’s brink and brow; it wears, therefore,
no halo of unnecessary human sacrifice. It is not
a tender token of attachment among lovers. It
does not live in myth, nor has it an important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
place in folk-lore. In short, it is just its own
bright, fascinating self; there is nothing of blatant
notoriety about its renown, no suspicion of a
<i>succès de scandale</i> such as the Edelweiss can so
justly claim.</p>

<p>We may laud the Edelweiss as a symbol of
advanced endeavour, but the Gentian is more
useful, if not, indeed, worthier, in this respect; for
it marks no great extreme and therefore its condition
is symbolic of less that is incompatible with
consistent human effort. Ruskin has somewhere
said that the most glorious repose is that of the
chamois panting on its bed of granite, rather
than that of the ox chewing the cud in its stall;
but, however transcendentally true this may be,
the actually glorious position lies midway betwixt
the two—the position of the Gentian in relation
with, for instance, the positions of the Edelweiss
and the Primrose. We are likely to derive inspiration
of more abundant practical value from
the Gentian than from the Edelweiss, because
there is comparatively little about it that is
extreme. Though advanced in circumstance it is
reasonably situated; it leads, therefore, to no such
flagrant inconsistency with facts, no such beating
of the drum of romance as, apparently, we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
so necessary in the case of Leontopodium. The
Edelweiss is not all it seems; the Gentian is.
“<i>Il ne suffit pas d’être, il faut paraître</i>”; and this,
certainly, the little Vernal Gentian does. In not
one single trait does it belie the high colour of
its blossom.</p>

<p>With what curiously different craft do each of
these flowers play upon the emotions! With what
contrary art does each make its appeal to our
regard and adulation! To each we may address
Swinburne’s stately lines: to each we may, and
do exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“... with my lips I kneel, and with my heart</div>
       <div class="verse">I fall about thy feet and worship thee ...”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Yet this act of adoration, when it affects the
Edelweiss, seems far more an act of idolatry
than it does when it affects the Gentian. For on
the one hand we have the Edelweiss stirring the
imagination to wild, foolhardy flights amid the awesome
summer haunts of the eagle and the chamois,
when, in simple reality, we could if we would be
reposing amongst hundreds of its woolly stars upon
some gentle pasture-slope away from the least
hint of danger and of <i>scandale</i>; while on the
other hand we have the Vernal Gentian calling us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
at once in all frankness to accept it as it is—one
of the truest and loveliest marvels of the Alps,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“... the fair earth’s fond expression</div>
       <div class="verse">Of tenderness for heaven above ...”!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">To each do we accord, as Mr. Augustine Birrell
would say, “a mass of greedy utterances”; to each
do we lose our hearts; but only to one do we lose
our heads. And that one is the Edelweiss: the
plant of leaves which ape a flower; the plant whose
flower is as inconspicuous as that of our common
Sun Spurge; the plant that would have us forget
its abundance on many a pasture, and think of
it only as clinging perilously to high-flung cliffs
where browse the chamois and where nest the
choughs.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The Gentian Family as a whole is possessed of
very striking individuality, and for the most part
its members arrest more than usual attention. Its
name is said to be derived from Gentius, King of
Illyria, who is reputed to have first made known
its medicinial properties—tonic, emetic, and narcotic.
Although it ranges from Behring’s Straits
to the Equator and on to the Antipodes, its residence
is mainly northern. In New Zealand its
chief colour is red; in Europe blue; and of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
its blue European representatives none can eclipse
perennial <i>verna’s</i> radiant star.</p>

<p>The Vernal Gentian is no stranger to England,
though, as an indigenous plant, it is a stranger to
most Englishmen. It is still to be found on wet
limestone rocks in Northern England (Teesdale)
and also in the north-west of Ireland. Like
<i>Gentiana nivalis</i> of the small band of Alpine
annuals and tiniest of the blue-starred Gentians,
it lingers in the British Isles, a rare, pathetic
remnant of past salubrity of climate and condition;
and to its homes in England and Ireland,
rather than in Switzerland, we should perhaps go
to study how to grow it in our gardens more
successfully than we do at present. But it is to
the Alps that we must turn to find it revelling
wealthily in a setting for which it is pre-eminently
suited; it is there that its</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“... living flowers</div>
       <div class="verse">Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For, in the Alps, it is an abundant denizen of the
pastures in general: both the grazing pastures or
“Alps,” and “the artificial modifications of the
pastures,” as Mr. Newell Arber calls the meadows.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i089.jpg" id="i089.jpg"></a>

  <div class="caption">The PARADISE LILY (<i>Paradisia Liliastrum</i>)
    near the Glacier de Trient about the
    middle of June.</div>
</div>

<p>If we wanted to give this Gentian an English
name (and far be it from me to suggest that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
should do any such thing) we should probably
have to call it Spring-Felwort; Felwort being an
old-time title for <i>Gentiana amarella</i>, an annual
herb common to dry pastures and chalk downs in
England, and possibly at one time employed by
tanners. In the Jura Mountains <i>verna</i> goes by
the name of <i>Œil-de-chat</i>, and among the peasants
inhabiting the northern side of the Dent du Midi,
in the Canton de Valais, I have heard it referred
to as <i>Le Bas du Bon Dieu</i>; but, considering the
remarkably suggestive character of the plant, the
domain of folk-lore seems curiously empty of its
presence. This, possibly, is in part due to its
amazing abundance, and to the fact that it is to
be found from about 1,200 feet to about 10,000
feet, thus causing it to meet with the proverbial
fate of things familiar. But, at any rate, its dried
flowers, mixed with those of the Rhododendron
and the purple Viola, are used in the form of
“tea” by the montagnards as an antidote for chills
and rheumatism.</p>

<p>The appearance of <i>verna</i> upon the pastures is
not confined solely to the early springtime; though
this is the season of its greatest wealth, it may be
met with quite commonly in the late autumn.
Indeed it affects the days which circle round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
whole of winter; and I have found it several times
even at Christmas near Arveyes, above Gryon
(Vaud), upon steep southward-facing banks where
sun and wind combined to chase away the snow.
If, then, for no other reason than this, it seems
curious that romance has not gathered this Gentian
under its wing as it has the Edelweiss.</p>

<p>As for the radiant purity of its five-pointed
azure stars, it is perhaps only outshone by that of
the Myosotis-like flowers of <i>Eritrichium nanum</i>,
King of the Alps; but even this rivalry is doubtful
when <i>verna</i> is growing upon a limestone soil,
where its blossoms are more brilliant than those
produced upon granitic ground.</p>

<p>Blue, however, although it is the superabundant
type-colour, is not the invariable hue of its blossoms;
indeed, it shows more variety than even
many a botanist suspects, and I have found it in
all tints from deep French to pale Cambridge blue,
from rich red-purple to the palest lilac, and from
the faintest yellow-white, through blush-white, to
the purest blue-white. I have, too, found it party-coloured,
blue-and-white.</p>

<p>These many variations from the type give
occasion for suggestive questions that I fain would
indicate, because I believe with Mr. Arber that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
such variations can only “arise from deep-seated
tendencies, which find their expression in the
existence of the individual, and the evolution of
the race.” For instance, are the mauve and plum-coloured
flowers a break-back to the ancestral
type; that is to say, was the more primitive <i>verna</i>
red? Blue flowers are more highly organised than
those of other colours; are, then, all flowers striving
to be blue—like Emerson’s grass, “striving to
be man?” The French-blue Gentians are of
warmer tint than those of Cambridge hue; are
they, therefore, the first decided step into this
highest of the primary colours: are they the first
strikingly victorious effort of the plant to shake off
all trammel of red? And white; what of white?
I have seen white <i>verna</i> tinged with rose, and
white <i>verna</i> of a white altogether free from any
tint of grossness—a white so positive as to suggest
the utmost frailty arising from degeneracy, if it
were not known to be the natural consequence of
persistent advance through blue. These are nice
points for speculation.</p>

<p>But “let us not rove; let us sit at home with
the cause”! Blue for us is the essential colour for
this Gentian: we can dispense with all its efforts to
be white. Blue, not white, is the hue of promise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
And it is promise we look for at the turn of the
year; it is promise we must have after long months
of snow. When youthful “chevalier Printemps”
hymns us his ancient message; when in penetrating
accents of triumph he tells us:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—when, I say, spring thus speaks to us of the rout
of winter and the dawn of a wealthier life, it is
blue that we look for most upon the frost-stained
fields; blue not white—the blue of the type-flowered
Gentian, not the white of the Alpine
Crowfoot and Crocus.</p>

<p>Whilst writing these lines on the most fascinating
spring flower of the Alps, there comes before my
mind one spot in particular where it abounds in
May—a certain long and rapid grassy slope at
Le Planet, above Argentière (Haute-Savoie).
Albeit not in Switzerland, Le Planet is only just
across the frontier; and, as every one who knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the district will attest, it is difficult to draw a rigid,
formal line where flowers and mountains are so
knit in common semblance. Other rich scenes of
azure I can recall—as on the swelling slopes of the
Jura around the Suchet, or on the fields which
mount from Naters towards Bel-Alp; but none
forces itself to mind with such persistence as does
this slope at Le Planet. And it is because the
surrounding circumstance illustrates so well all
that I have been saying about this Gentian’s
presence in the spring.</p>

<p>The slope in question is not five minutes’ stroll
from the hotel. On the plateau itself <i>verna</i> is all
but absent, but on this broad and steep incline it
congregates in such amazing numbers that, as I
think on it, I am sure all I have said of this
witching flower is poor and paltry. After all,
verbal magniloquence is perhaps out of place, and
simplicity is the best translator of such magnificence.
All shades of brightest blue are here
presented; for, excepting a few pale plum-coloured
clusters, the brilliant type-flower is ubiquitous,
blending delightfully with the little yellow Violet
and with the white, fluffy seedheads of the
Coltsfoot.</p>

<p>But what, perhaps, makes this particular slope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
so appropriate in point of illustration for this
chapter is, that above it towers the mighty Aiguille
Verte, decked as in winter with its snows and ice,
and in the foreground lies the frozen remains of
a great avalanche strewn with fallen rocks and
pierced by stricken larch-trees.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>Yes; from the lichen, <i>Umbilicaria virginis</i>, the
furthest outpost of vegetable life as it clings to the
Jungfrau’s awful rocks at an altitude of 13,000
feet, to the yellow Primrose of the woods and
meadows of the plains, there is no plant of Alpland
that is so precious, so rare in its very abundance
as <i>Gentiana verna</i>.  Nor is there another
Alpine that can make so wide and so certain an
appeal. Spread broadcast and alone upon the
awakening turf of mountain slope and meadow, it
captivates the instant attention of even the merest
passer-by. And if amongst its abounding azure
there happens, as will often be the case, a vigorous
admixture of healthy rose and yellow—the rose of
the Mealy or Bird’s-eye Primula, the yellow of the
Sulphur Anemone and Marsh Marigold—then this
were a scene to “make the pomp of emperors
ridiculous”; a scene of subtly true magnificence,
of perfectly balanced delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>See the Vernal Gentian as it lies thus bountifully
set, a radiant blue carpet of heavenly intensity,
backed majestically by winter’s receding snows
on mighty glacier and stupendous peak; note its
myriad white-eyed, cœrulean blossoms over which
hover with tireless wing its faithful, eager friends,
the humming-bird and bee hawk-moths—the very
picture of security and peace amid a scene of
awful, threatening grandeur. Listen—listen, the
while, to the thunder coming from “the vexed
paths of the avalanches”; listen to the sound of
falling rock and pine, and mark the great air-tossed
cloud of powdered snow; listen to the alarm-cry
of the speckled mountain-jay, and to the shriek-like
warning of the marmot; then tell me if there
is any other flower that could so well play the
part of hope-inspiring herald to a world as harassed
as is that of the Alps in the season that surrounds
the winter?</p>

is surplanting another in startlingly swift succession,
and the first-fruits of the Alpine year are
already on the wane, we will take our own time
and study this progress with deliberate care and
attention. We have seen May smiling; we ought—nay,
we are in duty bound—to see her frowning.
Like the récluse of Walden, we ought each of us
to become a “self-appointed inspector of snowstorms
and rainstorms.”</p>

</div>

<p>An undoubtedly noble and proper philosophy
assures us that there is truth and beauty in no
matter what condition, and that they who see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
nothing but what is tiresome or hideous in certain
estates, draw the overplus of tiresomeness and
hideousness from their own selves. “Beauty is
truth, and truth is beauty,” says this philosophy;
“how, then,” it queries, “can any condition be
unbeautiful? Is it not yourselves who are in part
lacking in a sense of loveliness, since truth can
never really be unbeautiful?”</p>

<p>Now, whatever we think of this as a species of
sophistry, it behoves us to look into it with quiet
and decent care. An everyday world, deep in its
old conventions, will declare that it is certainly
straining a point to try thus to make all geese
appear as swans. With the exception of the poet
minded to verse the innate grandeur of gloom, the
entire sublimity of storm, the entrancing mellowness
of fog and rain, and the wild joy which comes
with a blizzard; or perhaps of the painter minded
to achieve in paint what the poet is doing in ink
(both of them, most probably, contriving their
rhapsodies within the snug seclusion of their rooms)—with
the exception of these two privileged
persons comfortably absorbed in justifying a bias,
an everyday world, voting bad weather a kill-joy
and mar-plot, will find happiness only in avoiding
and forgetting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Be that as it may; be fog, wind, and cloud and
driving rain and sleet a luxury in which we should
revel—or not; of all places in the world in bad
weather, the Alps at springtide and at the altitude
at which we are now studying them, are probably
among the most interesting and absorbing. Let
an everyday world, or as much of it as can, come
and judge for itself.</p>

<p>If in our composition we have a grain of love
for Nature and for Nature-study, there is a fund
of opportunity for exercising it even in cloudland
at its gloomiest; and if, as in the present case, we
are bent upon studying the flowers and the means
for their more adequate reception into our English
homelands, then bad weather holds for us an
amount of experience such as will aid us materially
in our object. “Inclemency” takes so large a share
in the nurture of these flowers. By companying
with them when steeped in cloud and swept by
wind, we catch an important glimpse of the grim
and forceful side of their existence which is a
prime cause of the superlative loveliness that so
impresses us when the sun does shine from out an
immaculate azure.</p>

<p>Just as the cheese-mite is a product of the cheese,
and has attained its beauty and efficiency because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of the nature of cheese, so are these Alpines the
wonderful things they are because of the nature
of the conditions with which they have to contend
and upon which they have to subsist. It is all
very well for us to arrive upon the scene at this
late moment in their existence, transplant them to
our gardens, and there grow them, maybe, with
marked success; it is all very well for us to annex
them now to our retinue of chattels, lord it over
them, and display them on our rockworks as if it
were to us and to our care and trouble that they
owe their beauty; but these plants have arrived at
what they are without us and our attentions. Our
gardens never made them what they are, or gave
them one particle of their supreme and striking
beauty. Nor are our gardens likely to heighten
that beauty in any real way; much more likely
is it that we shall arrive at degrading their refinement
by bringing it down from the severe purity
of the skies to the grosser, easier circumstance of
our sheltered soil.</p>

<p>Alpine plants, perhaps because of the extreme
conditions with which they have to contend, and
therefore because of the extreme measures they
have to take in order to defend themselves, seem
to be possessed of an efficiency surpassing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of most other plants. They are what incessant
warfare has made of them; they delight in it.
Strenuous children of strenuous circumstance, they
are self-reliant to a degree, and hold themselves
with a winning air of independence. But it is
independence begot of strict dependence; they
admit as much quite frankly and sanely—an admittal
of which man might well make a note in
red ink. Nature all over the world is saying, not,
“Let me help you to be independent,” but, “You
shall and must depend upon me for your independence.”
And no living things have better
understood this truth than have the Alpines; no
living things have acknowledged and mastered this
obligation more thoroughly than they. Hence
their beauty; hence their serenity and “nerve”;
hence their “blended holiness of earth and sky.”</p>

<p>Mark with what consummate efficiency these
Alpine field-flowers cope with stern inclemency.
Tossed and torn by storms for which the Alps
are famous, see how they anchor themselves to
Mother Earth! Washed by torrential rains upon
the rapid slopes, or parched by the most personal
of suns, small wonder that their roots, in many
cases, should form by far the greater part of their
bulk and stature. They recall to mind that learned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
professor who, wishing possibly to postulate something
“new,” declared to an unconvinced but
amused world that what it saw of a tree was not
the tree—the tree was underground.</p>

<p>Whilst painting in the Val d’Arpette in June
of this year (1910), I met with a striking instance
of the boisterous treatment to which these plants
must accustom themselves. The day was radiantly
fine (as any one may see from the picture facing
page 24), yet suddenly, and without warning, a
most violent wind tore through the little valley,
sweeping everything loose and insecure before it,
upsetting my easel and camp-stool, carrying my
Panama hat up on to the snow, and making of
the Anemones and Violas a truly sorry sight.</p>

<p>This violence, albeit of a somewhat different
nature, reminded me of several experiences I had
had of uncommonly powerful eddies of wind,
travelling, like some waterspout at sea, slowly,
in growling, whirring spirals, over the steep
pastures, tearing up the grass and blossoms and
carrying them straight and high up into the air;
whilst all around—except myself!—remained unmoved
and peaceful. I have seen such eddies
strike a forest, shaking and swaying the giant
pines like saplings, wrenching off dead wood and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
many a piece of living branch, and whirling them
aloft. Under a glorious sky and amid the solitude
and stillness of the Alps, such violence is at least
uncanny, if not a little unnerving. One is moved
to turn in admiration to the ever-smiling Alpines
and ejaculate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Brave flowers—that I could gallant it like you,</div>
       <div class="verse">And be as little vain!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With this as a sample—and a by no means
uncommon sample—of what they have to withstand,
small wonder that so many of these plants
have endowed themselves with such a deep,
tenacious grip upon their home! Try with your
trowel to dig up an entire root of, for instance,
the Alpine Clover (<i>Trifolium alpinum</i>), or the
Sulphur Anemone, or the Bearded Campanula,
or the tall blue Rampion (<i>Phyteuma betonicifolium</i>),
or even so diminutive a plant as <i>Sibbaldia procumbens</i>,
or of so modest a one as <i>Plantago alpina</i>,
and you will be astounded at the depth to which
you must delve. You will find it the same with a
hundred other subjects; and, unless you be digging
in some loose and gritty soil, most probably your
amazement will end in despair, and in destruction
to the plant. More likely than not, you will hack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
through the main root long before you have unearthed
the end of it. If for no other reason than
this, then, it is at least unwise to try to uproot
these pasture-flowers. Should they be required
for the home-garden, it is far wiser and better
behaviour to gather seed from them later in the
season. Most of them grow admirably from seed
thus gathered and <i>sown as soon as possible</i>; most
of them develop rapidly and blossom within two
years; and with this grand advantage over uprooted
plants—they are able to acclimatize themselves
from birth to their new conditions and
surroundings, their translation being no rude and
abrupt transition from one climate to another.</p>

<p>In this and in many other directions, it is when
bad weather sweeps the Alps that we can perhaps
best learn from Nature what Emerson learnt from
her: that “she suffers nothing to remain in her
Kingdom which cannot help itself.” And, in
learning how these plants help themselves, we
are also learning how best we can help them when
we remove them to our gardens. Bad weather
is the greatest of teachers all the world over. On
sunny days we enjoy and admire what is very
largely the product of the storms.</p>

<p>Everything, even the worst thing, in its place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
is a good thing. As all sunshine and no storm
would make man a nonentity, so would it produce
Alpines devoid of their present great ability and
comeliness. A thing of complete beauty is a thing
of all weathers; and it is a thing of present joy,
and of joy for ever, because of much anguish
in the past. You and I could see nothing of
loveliness if it were not for ugliness; and these
Alpines would not be worth looking at were it
not for the awful attempts made by Nature to
overwhelm them. “A perpetual calm will never
make a sailor”; or, as Mr. Dooley says, “Foorce
rules the wurruld”—and keeps it peacefully disturbed,
bewitchingly “alive.”</p>

<p>And Alpine inclemency possesses an æsthetic
value which is as important as it is alluring.
Whether “in the smiles or anger of the high air,”
these flower-fields are invariably things of beauty;
even as the diamond glitters in the gloom, so do
these pastures shine throughout the storm. What
could be more æsthetically beautiful than the
rosy expanses of Mealy Primrose bathed in dense,
driving mists, or (as in the picture facing page 16)
the regiments of Globe-Flower, standing pale but
fascinating, in weather which, were we down on
the plains, we should consider “not fit for a dog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to be abroad in”? Or what more winsome than
the widespread colonies of Bartsia, Micheli’s Daisy,
Pedicularis, Biscutella, and Bell-Gentian (<i>Gentiana
verna</i>, unfortunately, is closed when the sun hides
itself), lying subdued but colour-full beside the
steaming waters of the lake?</p>

<p>Ah! where one of these Alpine lakes is in the
landscape, what wonders of Nature’s artistry we
may watch when rough winds howl and toss the
seething cloud into ever-changing combinations of
tint, form, and texture!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>

<p class="noindent">A hundred hues of grey fill the vapour-laden air
and are mirrored in receptive waters—hues with
which the fresh rose of the Primula and the rich,
full yellow of the Marsh-Marigold blend with
perfect felicity, lending that touch of human appeal
which makes the scene ideal.</p>

<p>The forests, too, are never so picturesque as
when clouds cling to the pine and larch, softening
the tone and carriage of these somewhat formal
trees, and breaking up every suggestion of monotony
in their reiterated masses. A soft, weird, intimately
mysterious beauty reigns over everything.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
What matter the winds and the rains if they
bring us such expression? By what is regret
justified in all this witchery? Regret that the sun
no longer shines, inducing the Vernal Gentian to
open wide its bright blue eyes? Nay; here, in
Alp-land, if nowhere else, does an ultimate
philosophy speak possibly of what is actual; here,
if nowhere else, bad weather is but a delightful
foil to bright and sunny days. Regret! There
is no right room for such repining: no sound and
balanced reason to moan, as moans, for instance,
the Chinese poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“If only to darken the darkness, O Thou in Thy heavens above,</div>
       <div class="verse">Why dost Thou light for a moment the lamp of a
	     beautiful thing?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For in the Alps the lamp of Beauty burns without
cessation; and where wondrous flowering pastures
border some rough-cut lake, legacy from glaciers
long since retired, the lamp burns always brightly.</p>

<p>By writing of inclemency in such full-flavoured
tones, I am not trying to make the best of a bad
case; I am simply and honestly setting forth the
undoubted good there is in what may seem “impossible.”
Any one who has lived with these things
and has watched them springtime after springtime,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
is usually in no way eager to run away, although
well aware that the sheltered distractions of the
towns are within quite easy reach. One finds no
really compensating counterpart in kursaals and
shop-windows for an Alpine springtime where
flowering pastures kiss “the crystal treasures of
the liquid world.” One need not be a poet, one
need not be a painter, one need not be a mystic,
and one certainly need be no “neurasthenic” to
appreciate the figurative sunshine of which spring’s
Alpine inclemency is redolent. One has but to
be natural—a sanely-simple human being, dismissing
the hampering prejudices and conventions
born of towns, and allowing the appeal of Nature
to come freely into its own. Then oneself is
busy a-weaving—a-weaving of cobweb dreams;
and the cobwebs are woven of material worthy,
substantial, and real. One’s dreams are not of that
solid, sordid order, nor of that frail, unhealthy
nature so common with dreams arising from unnatural
town-life. They are children of completest
sanity, and they are in no part begot of <i>ennui</i>.
One builds, and one builds for health’s sake; nor
does the building know aught of “castles in Spain.”
There is no question here of anæmic fancy. All
that one dreams is not only possible, but sound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
touching upon realities which control and direct
the best of destinies. Compared with town-life,
one is in a new world; and it is often astounding
to think that town-life is a necessity to which one
is obliged to add the important word “imperative.”</p>

<p>And all this may be so even in wet weather.
Here, even when clouds hold everything in damp
and clinging embrace, we may</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Grow rich in that which never taketh rust.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And grow rich quite comfortably; for have we not
our mackintoshes and goloshes!</p>

<p>The Alps are not ours for climbing purpose
only. They are not for us only when winter
rules and gives us sports abounding, or when the
snows retire to the cradles of the glaciers, and the
days of late July and those of August and September
grant us the conditions we most seek for
long excursions. They are ours also for an intermediate
season: a season of the utmost value,
though, maybe, not for “sport.” Mr. Frederic
Harrison, speaking of “the eternal mountains,
vocal with all the most majestic and stirring
appeals to the human spirit,” and of the treatment
of them by those who think only of “rushing from
pass to pass and from peak to peak in order to beat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Tompkins time or establish a new record,” says:
“Switzerland might be made one of the most
exquisite schools of every sense of beauty, one of
the most pathetic schools of spiritual wonder.”
And Mr. Harrison is right: this school exists, and
is no mere fiction wrought of sentimental thinking.
Nor is it ever closed to students—although there
be periods when the attendance is lamentably
slack. We know that its doors stand wide open
in the winter and in the summer; let it be
known, and as well known, that they stand equally
wide open in the spring. Let it be known,
moreover, that in spite sometimes of fickle, fitful
weather, it is in the spring, above all other
seasons, that this school is “one of the most
exquisite schools of every sense of beauty, one of
the most pathetic schools of spiritual wonder.”</p>

<p class="noindent">and we are aware that during the brief period of
inclemency a very astonishing change has been
taking place in our surroundings under cover of
the heavy mists. Nature has been speedily busy,
robing the fields in garments fit for June. Before
the mists closed down upon us a few days ago
insect-life was noticeable mostly by its scarcity.
Except for the Orange-Tip and Dingy Skipper
butterflies, and for the Skipper-like moth, <i>Euclidia
Mi</i>, flitting among the Saponarias, Daisies, and
Geums, and for a dainty milk-white spider on the
rosy heads of <i>Primula farinosa</i>, there was little
of “life” among the flowers. But now the butterflies
are legion, a brilliant pea-green spider has
joined the white one, and lustrous little beetles—among
the most beautiful of Alpine creatures—are
either frolicking or basking in the glorious
sunshine on the wild Peppermint and other
fragrant herbs. As for the flowers themselves,
they have more than doubled in kind, if not
actually in beauty and in number.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is such transformation in the
meadows as makes us rub our eyes and wonder
if we have not slept the sleep of Rip van Winkle!
The Gentians have all but gone, the Anemone
also, and <i>Primula farinosa</i> has become most rare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
In their places stand the Globe-Flower, the Bistort,
the Paradise Lily (barely open), the Sylvan
Geranium, the blue Centaurea, and the pale yellow
Biscutella, while the last blossoms of <i>Anemone
sulphurea</i> have been joined by the exquisite blush-tinted
heads of <i>Anemone narcissiflora</i>.  It is as

another landscape—one which, as we are but

we did the last. For—</p>

England think that we who write of the Swiss

of hysteria, or else do wilfully point our story as
if it were a snake story or the story of a tiger-hunt.
But, let the fact be known, in writing or
speaking upon this subject, the exigencies of the
English language oblige us to be temperate; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
is quite impossible to exaggerate. We may use
all the adjectives in Webster, yet have we not
even then said enough. Acutely conscious of our
ineffectual effort, we have, nevertheless, done our
best. We could say no more: the rest we must
feel, and endeavour that our readers shall feel
with us.</p>

<p>Maybe it is with us as it was with Robert
Louis Stevenson when he was at Davos in search
of a remedy for the malady that afterwards drove
him to Samoa and to an early grave upon her
mountains—maybe all our “little fishes talk like
whales”; but, believe us, whale-talk is the only
talk befitting. If Stevenson finds “it is the Alps
who are to blame,” we find it is quite as much
the fault of the Alpine flora; and if Stevenson
found comfort in the fact that he was not alone in
being forced to “this yeasty inflation, this stiff
and strutting architecture of the sentence,” so also
can we.</p>

<p>We English are not the only ones to find
ourselves at the ineffectual extreme of language.
The German tourist—and he is nowadays more
enterprisingly early than are we in visiting the
Alps—is equally at a loss, as he stands in wonderment
and, with characteristic emphasis, repeatedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
utters the one resounding word “Kolossal!”
Even the Englishman loses his habitual reserve,
and, if he does not voice his wonderment as
loudly as does his Teutonic brother, he is at
least amazed in his own insular way. Assuredly,
if these flowers themselves could speak, and speak
out frankly, they would declare our seemingly
over-coloured appreciation a very tame performance;
they would vouch that we are a long way
from being in the shoes of the proverbial amateur
fisherman.</p>

<p>But let me, without further ado, attempt to
describe some of the cause for this. Let me turn
again for example to Champex and to notes made
on the spot, and speak of a seven-hours’ walk down
the rapid southern slopes which fall away from
the lake, by the village of Prassorny, along the
Val Ferret to Praz de Fort and the <i>massif</i> of
Saleinaz, and back again to Champex by that
scramble of a path which mounts the slopes
directly from the village of Ville d’Issert. This
walk takes us from 4,800 feet down to some 3,300
feet, and affords us as representative a range of
slopes and fields as we could find anywhere.
Starting amid rolling <i>hectares</i> of Orchids and

Lychnis and Anthericum, winding through copse
and forest-edge peopled with Everlasting Pea and
Alpine Eglantine, we arrive by entrancing stages
amid crowded meadows of Salvia, Bistort, Ranunculus,
Campion, Marguerite, Geranium, Campanula,
and Phyteuma—meadows which, in long and
wide-flung swell, sweep like a multi-coloured wave
to lave the snowy sides and graceful, flowing forms
of the Groupe du Grand Saint-Bernard and Grand
Golliaz.</p>

<p>Used as I am to the glories of the mountain
flora, I am moved afresh to wonder each time I
come intimately amongst them, and such a walk as I
took this day, the 15th of June, is always a revelation.
From the very start to the very finish there
was a continuous procession of as amazingly rich
and variedly coloured fields as, surely, any quarter
of the globe would find it difficult to surpass.
Sometimes the predominant colour was clear
yellow, sometimes rich French blue, and not infrequently,
when there was no such distinct predominance,
the fields, especially when the sun
was at the back of me, were as bewildering as,
I imagine, would be fields flashing with a profusion
of every known gem. Steep grassy slopes—in
places almost perpendicular; long, hot stretches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
grass-grown grit and rubble; rich ousy dips and
hollows; undulating acres of wavy, feather-light
meadows—all were decked alike in such kaleidoscopic
abundance as forced me repeatedly to
exclaim: “Oh that some of this loveliness could be
translated as fields to England! If only England
would try!”</p>

<p>Here I must beg leave to make a slight digression
from the strictness of my subject. At
one spot in the steep descent, just outside the
tiny hamlet of Prassorny, I came upon a blaze
of colour which stood out from all else—a pre-eminently
arresting object in the landscape. It
was, of all things, our old friend the scarlet Field
Poppy! To come upon this inimitable flower
spread in serried numbers over a large square of
ground on a steep slope at an altitude of over
4,000 feet, was not a little surprising. Waving
its battalions of fiery blossoms against the grey
mist-filled valley beneath, with old sun and wind-stained
châlets standing just beside, it was an
irresistible <i>motif</i> for a painter. Seemingly as
much at home as in any field in England, it
appeared of even greater brilliance than with
us—having, perhaps, caught something of the
humour of the Gentian. That this Poppy can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
possibly intensify its hue over and above what
we know it can achieve in the cornfields of the
plains, will seem incredible—another instance of
whale-talk on the writer’s part! And yet such
is certainly the case—as, indeed, it is the case
with many another lowland flower whose powers
will allow it to climb. These poppies, here on
this slope, stood witness for the fact; and so,
too, did the other lowland flowers growing with
them. There were Cornflowers and Larkspur of
a blue more rich and radiant than it is even in
the plains; and <i>Viola tricolor</i>, too, the Pansy
of our own cornfields, was of a purple and yellow
more deep than we are accustomed to have it.
There was, also, the exquisite <i>Adonis aestivalis</i>
of most vivid salmon-orange—its dainty blossoms
standing like fire-flies against the rich blue masses
of <i>Salvia pratensis</i>.i>.</p>

<p>Yet this was not a corn-patch (one can scarcely
call them cornfields at this altitude, where they
are mere terraces, many of them, like potato-patches,
standing almost at an angle of 45°, carved
from out the steep mountain-side by generations
of thrifty peasants). In all probability, however,
this particular terrace with its wealth of cornfield
flowers had in quite recent years been sown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
with oats or rye. Anyway, it were well worth
taking note of this Poppy’s presence hereabouts,
if only because on the slope next door was the
Bell-Gentian!</p>

<p>After this “parenthetic enthusiasm” over so
homely an intruder, we will hie us back to the
more usual denizens of these slopes and fields.
Perhaps enough has already been said to show
what a poor thing language is when in the
presence of such splendours as June spreads
before us in the Alps. Very few, if any, of the
flowers were growing singly or even sparsely;
they were usually in dense bright masses, or close
and broad-spread legions, forming an “infinite
floral broidery” stretching above, below, in front,
and behind as far as eye could reach. What a
difficult, almost impossible matter it has been to
select for pictorial presentation such sections of
this wealthy panorama as shall give some small
idea of the whole, will readily be understood.
Halting attempts, however, will be found in the
pictures facing pages 32 and 48. And to supplement
and reinforce these, there is, at the end of this
chapter, a short list of the chief grass-land flowers
met with during my walk. The rock-plants, and
those liking the poorest of soil, though they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
certainly add an important quota to the brilliant
prospect, have not been taken into account, as
they fall somewhat outside our present purpose.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>In his poem, “In Praise of June,” Leigh Hunt
sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“May, by coming first in sight,</div>
       <div class="verse">Half defrauds thee of thy right;</div>
       <div class="verse">For her best is shared by thee</div>
       <div class="verse">With a wealthier potency;</div>
       <div class="verse">So that thou dost bring us in</div>
       <div class="verse">A sort of May-time masculine.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But this is only in small part true of these
Alpine fields. There is, to be sure, something
of the May fields in the June fields, but all of
May’s best is certainly not shared by June—not,
that is to say, unless we climb up higher than
we intend to do. The Crocus and Soldanella
have gone; they came “to show the paths that
June must tread,” not to tread those paths with
the Orchid and the Lily. Gone, also, is the pure
yellow-petalled Mountain Geum. The Marsh
Marigold, too, is no longer with us in rich,
golden crowds; nor does the Mealy Primula
spread its rosy carpet over acre upon acre. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
misses, also, the bright white presence of Micheli’s
Daisy; and the Vernal Gentian, “blue with the
beauty of windless skies,” though still lingering
here and there, is, for the most part, hidden by
the Grasses and the Clovers.</p>

<p>Ah! yes, the Clovers—pink, rose-red, crimson,
cream, white, yellow: we must not forget these!
Of goodly and varied company, they are such important
units in the rich composition of most
Alpine meadows, and, where they grow, they form
so compact a groundwork of colouring and so
admirable a setting for many of the taller flowers,
that it were, indeed, a dereliction of memory to
overlook them! What could be lovelier than a
wide area of these Clovers in June sown with lilac,
rose-tinted, and white Orchids, deep, lustrous-blue
Phyteumas, paper-white Paradise Lilies, and infinite
hosts of the bright and fascinating little
Euphrasia? Or in July, when the orange Arnica,
the porcelain-blue <i>Campanula barbata</i>, and the
graceful, distinguished-looking little <i>Thesium alpinum</i>
make their ever-welcome appearance in the
fields? Of course, there are degrees even in
natural felicity, and the Orchids—with the exception
of the creamy-white Butterfly Orchis—are
not at their best if the predominant Clover be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
red. But, speaking generally, the groundwork of
Clovers is a most valuable element in the colouring
of these pastures. Were this groundwork
removed we should wonder why the fields and
slopes looked so meagre and thin. And this is
also true of <i>Euphrasia officinalis</i>, the Eyebright,
a very precious, though humble denizen of the
fields in July. This plant, by the way, owes its
English name, not to its flower (as in the case
of the little bright-blue Speedwell, <i>Veronica
Chamædrys</i>, often erroneously called Eyebright),
but to an infusion of the plant which long ago
was supposed to cure defective vision. Milton,
indeed, causes the Archangel Michael to use it
upon Adam:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“... then purged with Euphrasy and Rue</div>
       <div class="verse">The visual nerve, for he had much to see.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i137.jpg" id="i137.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i137.jpg"
        alt="" width="439" height="600" />
  <div class="caption">EVENING among the fields of pink Bistort at
    Lac Champex; sunset-glow on the Grand
    Combin, July.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Like the Clovers, the Eyebright should certainly
not be ignored, though it is easy to
do so. It may be numbered amongst those
things we should miss without being able to
say <i>what</i> we do miss—those things of a high
and unobtrusive value, partly composed of half
the worth of things in greater evidence. In
other words, it is amongst those things which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in a quiet, self-effacing way, enhance their surroundings.</p>

<p>In applying the term “distinguished-looking”
to the little Thesium, I am minded to do so
because, just as with the flowers of the plain,
there is an <i>élite</i> among Alpines. One can hardly
explain why. Like the Roman Emperor who,
when asked to define time, said, “I know when
you do not ask me,” one feels there is an <i>élite</i>
among flowers, though one is scarcely able to
define it. And the feeling is real and undoubtedly
well-founded. Nor, to feel this, is it necessary
to go to florist’s garden-flowers, where vulgarity is
rampant (though often highly prized and priced).
The feeling comes in the presence of any field
of wild flowers—the feeling that, by their form
and bearing, some plants are more well-bred than
others. This cannot be altogether accounted for
by their colour or conspicuousness. The little
Thesium, or the little silver-leaved Alchemilla are
neither of them bright, conspicuous plants. It is
the general habit that impresses: the “atmosphere”
with which they surround themselves. How
manifest this is when one meets with the Paradise
Lily surrounded by a sea of Hieracium, Bistort,
Blue Bottle, Trollius, Geranium, and Salvia. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
singles out the Lily at once, though it be close
beside the exquisite white Marguerite; and one’s
heart goes out to it, above its companions, as a
thing of greater breeding—a thing taking rank
with any Lœlia or Dendrobium.</p>

<p>A cat is not a horse because it is born in
a stable; and all Alpines are not of the same
caste because they are born in the Alps. Among
things Alpine, as among things of the plain,
there is degree in attainment. Some things
have had occasion to travel along lines that
have led them to greater refinement than others—just
as man, himself, is evidently the product
of particular occasion for such travel. We cannot
blink ourselves to the fact that there are weeds
even among the Alpines—though there are not
so many as 280, the number said to exist in
England.</p>

<p>Degree in refinement is, perhaps, to some extent
indicated by the way a plant will take care of
itself. All plants have some means of fending for
themselves, and these means are as varied in
morality as are such means among human beings.
Some are born fighters, brazen, pushing, and
quarrelsome; others win through life by comparative
self-effacement. Some elbow their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
to any place they want; others, seemingly, are
content to be where they are wanted. All, of
course, battle more or less faithfully, but some
are forceful, self-assertive, while others resign
themselves to unobtrusiveness. No plant can
accept with entire equanimity what does not
altogether agree with it; but many can rough it,
putting up with conditions that will kill others
or compel them to retire. Hence we have weeds:
rough-souled invaders who make themselves too
common.</p>

<p>Although “the invariable mark of wisdom
is to see the miraculous in the common,” and
although, therefore, we may admire, and quite
reasonably admire, all that so capably wrestles
with extremes of circumstance as do the Alpines,
yet we can and must admit that some are
more “classy” than others. For instance, the
Alpine Plantain is, according to our instinct and
possibly according to fact, on a lower rung of the
ladder of vegetable society than is the Alpine
Auricula. Both struggle with much the same
rigours and disabilities, but we feel obliged to find
that the latter has evolved greater refinement than
the former from its struggles. In short, Maeterlinck’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<i>goût du mieux de la Nature</i>”</span> is as pronounced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
in degree among Alpines as it is among
valley flowers; there is an aristocracy even in the
Alps.</p>

<p>And how admirable, for the most part, are the
names these plants bear; how befitting the romantic
character and circumstance which surrounds
them. Linaria, Saponaria, Salvia, Ajuga, Anthyllis,
Potentilla, Artemisia—what could be more
charming? Are they not a thousand times more
suggestive and more æsthetic than their English
counterparts—Toadflax, Soapwort, Sage, Bugle,
Kidney Vetch, Cinquefoil, Wormwood? Indeed,
I am not sure but that, taking them as a whole,
Latin names are not more satisfactory and picturesque
for every kind of flower—quite apart
from the important and simplifying question of a
common vantage ground for gardener, scientist,
and general public. The anonymous writer of
“Studies in Gardening,” an admirable series of
essays contributed to the <i>Times</i>, pleads persuasively
for the use, as far as possible, of English names in
both gardening books and papers. He holds—and
in so doing he is by no means singular—that “the
rage for Latin names has gone so far that you will
now sometimes see lilies called liliums”; he bemoans
the growing use of Sedum instead of Stone-crop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and of Antirrhinum instead of Snapdragon,
and he calls it an “unnecessary use of botanical
terms,” and thinks that “the want of beautiful
English names to many beautiful flowers seems a
reproach to their beauty.” But there are other
authorities, equally numerous, who hold a contrary
view, considering that too much is being made of
English names, and that “confusion worst confounded”
is a very natural consequence. One
catches the sound of more than two voices in the
discussion: one hears not only the several plaints
of botanist and flower-lover, but also the claims
of the champion of folk-lore, the mere amateur
gardener, the uncompromising patriot, and the
incorrigible sentimentalist. And something in
reason is said by each one of them—although
honours are not so easy as to enable one to call it
a case of six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.
For, perhaps, those who strive for a <i>langue bleu</i> in
this domain and choose Latin have the weightier
cause at heart. George Crabbe, the poet, once
wrote an English treatise on botany, but never
published it, because of the remonstrances of the
Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who objected
to degrading the science of botany by
treating it in a modern language. Such rigorous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
adhesion to Latin is of the relatively narrow past;
nor is this dead tongue likely ever again to be a
subject for such blind idolatry. No doubt in time
a becoming compromise will be arrived at by the
two camps—a compromise that will allow a rose
to be a rose, and not oblige it to be always and
only a <i>Rosa</i>.</p>

<p>“Men of science are pitiless tyrants,” says
Alphonse Karr in “Les Fleurs Animées.” “See
what they have done for Botany, that charming
and graceful study!... Without pity or mercy, they
have brutally seized upon the frail daughters of
sky and dew; they have crushed and mutilated
them; they have thrown them into the crucible
of Etymology, and after all these awful tortures,
and as if to assure themselves of impunity, they
have hidden their victims beneath a heap of
barbarous names. Thus, thanks to them, the
Hawthorn, that symbol of virginity and hope,
sighs under the dreadful name <i>Mespilus oxyacantha</i>....
All that is frightful, is it not?...
Unfortunately, it is all very necessary. To admire
is not to know, and, in order to know, system
and method are indispensable.... How could we
do without the help of Etymology? Pardon,
then, these men of science, who have done nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
but obey the law of necessity, and enter into
the beautiful domain from which they have dissipated
the darkness.” This is delightfully put
and is all very true. Latin nomenclature does
tend immensely to dispel confusion, though in
certain quarters it may wound the sense of sentiment,
and we shall no doubt always have confirmed
adherents of popular names.</p>

<p>But, however it may be with the use of popular
names in England, I venture to think we have
better things to do than to Anglicise the Alpines
in their Swiss home, and that—as says a well-known
botanist—“when English names are coined
for species which do not even occur in Britain,
the result is sometimes ridiculous, <i>e.g.</i> ‘Dodonœus’s
French Willow’ for an Epilobium.” And
it is not alone ridiculous: it is often paltry and
in the worst of taste, and it will frequently
drive romance and beauty from the Alpine landscape.
What is there æsthetic, or even useful,
about “Mignonette-leaved Lady’s Smock” for
<i>Cardamine resedifolia</i>; “Neglected Pinkwort” for
<i>Dianthus neglectus</i>; “Doronic Groundsel”
for <i>Senecio Doronicum</i>; or “Glacier’s Yarrow”
for <i>Achillea nana</i>? Are not the Latin names
truer and more beautiful? And are they not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
as easy of retention as their English substitutes?
Shall we say that <i>Campanula barbata</i> is not a
truer title than “Bearded Harebell” for a plant
that has nothing of the English Harebell about
it except “family”? Or shall we say that it is
not just as easy, as the botanist already quoted
points out, to remember <i>Atriplex deltoidea</i> as
“Deltoid-leaved Orache”? Those who, advocating
English nomenclature to this extent in the Alps,
plead the cause of intelligible simplicity, irresistibly
recall the complicated efforts of those who aim
at the Simple Life. And, on the whole, their
efforts are no less ugly.</p>

  <div class="caption">HAYMAKING at Champex in the middle of July.</div>
</div>

<p>But let us not stand haggling over such contentious
matter. <i>Revenons à nos moutons!</i></p>

<p>Scanning these fields and slopes, noting “the
lavish hand of June,” and remembering that July’s
hand will be no whit less lavish, we realise without
any difficulty that there are more than twice as
many flowering plants indigenous to Switzerland
as in the whole of the British Isles.  Indeed,
June alone could easily convince us of this. What
wealth! One feels that the proper way, the
only adequate way of enjoying it is to abjure
hotels and camp out in the midst of it all.
When the meal-time bell rings out from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Hôtel-Pension, one turns in answer to it with
reluctance, declaring:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“I could be content to see</div>
       <div class="verse">June and no variety,</div>
       <div class="verse">Loitering here, and living there,</div>
       <div class="verse">With a book and frugal fare,</div>
       <div class="verse">With a finer gypsy time,</div>
       <div class="verse">And a cuckoo in the clime.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when the end of June arrives, and with
it the Arnica, the Greater Astrantia, the orange-red
Hawkweed, the Burnet butterfly, and the
passage of the bell-decked cows to the higher
Alpine pastures—“Liauba! Liauba! <i>por alpa!</i>”—we
may tremble for the coming of the scythe.
Already it will be commencing its deadly work
2,000 feet below, and its advance is rapid and
quite regardless of all we flower-lovers may mutter
under our breath, or more probably say aloud.
However, we must be reasonable. Complaints
of this description are not in order. The world
must be helped round: hay must be made,
and the flowers are not, and cannot be, our
all-in-all. We benefit most by being seasonable;
sufficient for the day is the good thereof;
and the good of a day need not die with the
day. We take our fill of these flowers whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
we reasonably may; recollection does the rest for
us in the gap of seasons. An emotion passed is
yet part of our life—our life’s memory; and, in
Meredith’s words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Dead seasons quicken in one petal spot of colour unforgot.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For enough is far better than a feast. It is one
thing to be spiritually sentimental; it is quite
another thing to know where to draw a right
line in spiritual sentiment. Happy the man who
is endowed with the double capacity; happy the
man who can allow these flowers to lift him to
a higher plane of being; and then, when reasonableness
begins to flag, turn to his floral cicerones
and say with firmness: “Excuse me, but I must
now be getting back to dinner. And you, in
your turn, you know, must be preparing to be
dinner for the cows.”

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Our</span> knowledge
of life behind the balder manifestations
of life is as yet so deficient that it would
be pure conceit to pretend more than lightly to
suggest certain thoughts that may possibly commence
to explain something of the affinity existing
between ourselves and the flowers. That such
an affinity does actually exist there appears sufficient
evidence to warrant our believing, and no
one, I imagine, with an interested eye for these
matters, would care to pronounce against this
evidence without making careful reservations. And
if this affinity exists for one it exists for all, though
in some, because of the variable nature of the human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mechanism, it is less demonstrable than in others.
Nor does it show itself merely in our admiration
and care for the flowers; there are many instances
of its appearing in a form which borders upon
the “uncanny”—a form of that universal and
universally sympathetic subconsciousness which
Psychology is doing its best to investigate.</p>

<p>Thoreau in one of his Essays mentions how
that one day he wished to find a certain rare
orchid, but had no idea in which direction to seek
it; and, setting out in this blind state of mind,
his steps took him straight to the very object of
his quest. Of course those in whom prejudice
is a more real possession than open-mindedness
will dismiss such evidence as pointing to mere
coincidence or to an unmistakable case of chance.
They will say the same, too, of the instance mentioned
by Mr. H. Stuart Thompson in an article, “Ten
Days in Co. Kerry,” which appeared in the
<i>Gardeners’ Chronicle</i> for October 22, 1910. “My
companion,” says Mr. Thompson, “makes no claim
to be a botanist, but he has an innate faculty for
finding good plants if they are to be found; and
let it be said here that during a ski-ing holiday
in Switzerland last winter he managed to grub
up through the snow quite a wonderful collection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of interesting Alpines which are succeeding capitally
on his rockery.” This will also be called coincidence;
but there is, I believe, far less justification
for doing so than for calling it sympathy.
Personally, I have more liking for design in these
matters than I have for luck. Surely it were a
poor world—nay, an impossible world—that were
governed by chance in whatsoever degree. Evolution
may know no “categorical imperative” and
yet be a stranger to aimless drifting. The
law of cause and effect seems to guarantee this.
And is it not also guarantee of a universal
sympathy, since the prime essential of this law
is that all things are linked up in one continuous
chain?</p>

<p>My own experience among the flowers biases
me in favour of this sympathetic rule and causes
me to believe there is some means by which our
several beings can communicate. On many occasions
I have been led, with seeming intention,
to some rare white form that I was wishing to
find. Apparent purposelessness and lack of decision
have filled my mind, and yet, time after time,
have I taken the very path, or have scrambled
up the precise trackless slope which has brought
me to the whereabouts of the rarity I have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
seeking. On other occasions I have been arrested
in my walk and in the midst of quite other
thoughts of my own or of some conversation with
a companion by an impelling impression that a
floral rarity was in my immediate neighbourhood.
I have noticed, too, that this seeming guidance
has invariably happened in connection with white
flowers—the white form of <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i>,
for instance, or of <i>Gentiana excisa</i>, or of
<i>Soldanella alpina</i>, or of <i>Viola calcarata</i>, or of
<i>Aster alpinus</i>.  It may sound preposterously mystical,
but I do really suspect that I have found
these uncommon or rare flowers—perhaps there
was only one specimen within the district for
miles round—by something in their nature being
in tune with something in mine.  I do not
imagine success would attend upon conscious effort,
my own experience being that the promptings
have come without any striving on my part. I
have had most mixed and unconvincing results
and many total failures when experiment has been
conducted upon such lines as one might follow with
a water-finder.  I am aware that however much
in earnest one may be in speaking of this class of
phenomena, it is difficult to appear reasonable;
for the matter is so wrapped in haze. I can only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
repeat that the thing has happened to me when
I have been least expecting it.</p>

<p>I remember one case in particular, when I was
rambling with a friend upon the rapid slopes of
Dent de Bonnavaux, near Champéry. I was
longing to find the white form of <i>Gentiana
asclepiadea</i>, the Willow Gentian, about which I
had been reading. We had arrived where this
Gentian was growing in profusion in a semi-shade
afforded by giant cliffs, and had proceeded nearly
to the foot of the Pas d’Encel, when, feeling
suddenly persuaded that the plant I wanted was
near by, I called a halt. My friend said, “Oh,
let’s get on; there’s nothing here!” But I
begged for indulgence. “I feel,” said I, “that
the white form of the blue Gentian is growing
hereabouts, and I’m going to hunt it up.” For
some time I scrambled about without the required
result, and I was beginning to suspect that I was
being prompted more by a fussy imagination than
an intuitive sympathy; and yet I felt unable to
abandon the search, and determined not to do
so until I had gone all over the ground twice.
And then, at last—Eureka! there amongst the
grasses behind a big boulder were two lovely
sprays of purest white! Now, it was not as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
this were the first time that I had been amongst this
Gentian; many times before, and in many districts,
had I passed through quantities of it; but never
had I seen any variation except in the depth
and brightness of the blue, and never before had
I experienced the sensation of the near presence
of its white form. Nor can I recall any occasion
when this sensation has played me false. Over and
over again have I felt it, and with whatever plant
it has been associated it has invariably proved
truthfully prophetic. Will coincidence or luck
satisfactorily account for this? I am unable to
think so, though I confess I must exclaim as
Faust does:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Lo! here I sit no wiser than before”!</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But now that we are thus far, let us grope a
little further within the dim-lit domain of subconsciousness;
I would fain touch upon a matter
closely allied to the foregoing—that of the significance
of the colour of flowers, and the part played
by colour in the sympathy existing between the
flowers and ourselves. Let us first of all speculate
briefly upon the significance of floral colouring.
Speaking vaguely—and who can speak with any
very great distinctness?—colour is one of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
manifestations of one and the same fundamental
condition. Sound is another; odour another. Our
five senses, in fact, appear to deal with the self-same
set of fundamental truths and to translate
them differently: possibly upon the principle that
variety is charming and is much more likely to
arouse our complete inquisitiveness, ending ultimately
in our thorough appreciation, than would
these vital truths if brought to our notice in just
a single form. There are people to whom odours
represent colours; there are others to whom
Wagnerian music is largely coloured by scarlet
and all other reds, and to whom the note of the
blackbird is magenta and purple, and that of the
greenfinch yellow. There is, too, a case recorded
by the late Professor Lombroso, where a girl
could see things with the tip of her nose; Miss
Helen Keller, blind, deaf, and dumb, can feel
if a person is dark or fair; and it is said that
recently in Germany there was a man who, having
undergone an operation upon his head, was, after
recovery, obliged to seek the peace and comfort
of a dark cellar on fine days, because he could
hear the sun shining. Without staking the soundness
of my argument upon this last quotation, there
would seem enough evidence in the world to assure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
us that our senses deal with one and the same
set of realities, and that colour, sound, and odour
have birth in a self-same cause. What, then, are
these realities; what, then, is this cause in relation
with ourselves and the flowers; and what part
does colour play therein?</p>

<p>Of course, I am supposing that colour is really
in the flowers and not in us or in the bee, as
was suggested a few years ago by an American
<i>savant</i>.  I am unable to think that either myself
or a bee can determine the white form of some
blue Gentian, some rose-pink Ononis (Rest-Harrow),
or some yellow Primrose. If colour is not in the
flower, then neither is it in a lady’s dress, nor in
a nation’s flag, nor in a picture. What reason
should the world and his wife have for unanimously
declaring a dress to be brown and purple if, in
reality, it is no colour at all—if, that is to say,
it is black, or the highest refinement of black,
which is white? How comes it that a whole
nation with one accord looks upon its flag as a
combination of red, white, and blue when, in
reality, it is simply a design in black and white?
What are we doing by painting our hives a
variety of bright colours in order to lead the bees
safely home, if paint is no colour and bees can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
colour the hives as they will? It is beyond me;
I imagine it is beyond my readers; and I suspect
that if the truth were known it was even beyond
the American <i>savant</i> in his less imaginative
moments. Maybe things are not what they
seem, but can this be possible to the extent
implied by our Western cousin? I know, of
course, that we do largely befool ourselves; I
know that in part measure we are “All valiant
dust that builds on dust”; but I cannot believe
we befool ourselves to the extent of painting
pictures every imaginable tint when, really and
truly, all this colour is in ourselves. I, personally,
am old-fashioned enough to think that when I
squeeze gamboge out upon my palette I undoubtedly
have there a yellow, not a colourless
pigment. And I imagine that a bee thinks the
same when he flies, as frequently he will, head-foremost
into it, believing it to be a buttercup
or a marigold.</p>

<p>Yes, I am presuming that we human beings,
endowed though we are with abundant powers of
which we are greatly unconscious, have little
enough to do with a flower’s being mauve or
orange; and it is upon this possibly antiquated
and false understanding that I ask myself, What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
tale has the colour of flowers to tell us? In the
first place, I am not sure that I am content to
see white appearing solely between yellow and
pink in Dr. Percy Groom’s scale of floral colour;
the scale does not look quite true, running in the
following order: yellow, white, pink, red, crimson,
violet, blue. I should be more content if the order
ran like this: white, blue, green, yellow, orange,
red, violet, blue, white; for scales such as these, if
continued, form a circle, a complete and continuous
whole. They cannot rightly be cut up into abrupt
sections of straight lines if they are to tell the
whole truth. The green flowers appear to stand
as proof of this, for they draw their tint from both
extremities of the scale—from blue, the highest of
primal colours, and from yellow, the lowest; they
link up the extremities and complete the circle;
they have no definite qualities, but are at once high
and lowly.</p>

<p>If we start with the lowliest of flowers of
clean-cut individuality, it must be with the yellow
ones; and yellow stands for the dawn of definite
life. After that, for flowers of distinct position,
we must go to the red ones, those of orange tints
being intermediary; and with red we reach the
fulfilment of animal or worldly vigour. From this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
point onwards, through magenta, lilac, mauve,
violet, purple, refinement is increasingly marked
until blue is reached. Then blue, starting darkly,
advances to “Cambridge” tints, and so into
white.</p>

<p>Now white is the “colour” of which we know
the least—and talk the most. Really, it indicates
nothing—that which is as “a bunghole without a
barrel round it”—and of this, naturally, we can have
but a very inaccurate appreciation. We speak
glibly about white, and we soar with it to giddy,
dreamy heights, but we speak and mostly dream of
colour not of white. For—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,</div>
       <div class="verse">Stains the white radiance of eternity.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We talk of snow as if it were of no colour; but we
are able to talk about it only because it is so
colour-full. We talk arrogantly of ourselves as
“white people,” and we are able to do so because
we are not white people, but people with a rude
amount of red in us—“animals with red cheeks,”
as Nietzsche calls us; indeed, it is possible that the
negro has more right to call himself a white man,
for he is nearer to black than we are to white, and,
according to the well-known formula, “Black is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
white, white is black, and black is no colour at
all.”</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>ANEMONE SULPHUREA</i> and <i>GENTIANA
    EXCISA</i>, painted directly in the fields

</div>

<p>But what part does white play amongst the
flowers? To begin with, I believe we have no
right to restrict it to one particular place—between
yellow and red. It would seem to have no precise
position in the scale, for it is found appearing here,
there, and everywhere along the line. It occurs
amongst all colours, but if it has one more
permanent place than another, that place is outside
the line of colour altogether; and white, as a
permanency, is an extreme. The appearance of a
white form is often hailed as a case of anæmia in
the coloured type; and no doubt this is so frequently,
though it cannot be so always. Where
a white form is the issue of a blue type-flower,
such as a Gentian or a Campanula, it is most
probable that it is a case of natural evolution,
and that such a white plant is no more anæmic
than is anything which arrives naturally, progressively,
upon the higher plane of being. We of
a lower plane are not a little apt to regard as
weaklings things which emerge upon the higher
plane. Certainly a white flower is not necessarily
“too good to live.” If it be issue of a blue type-flower,
it is more likely than not to be in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
way well bred. Where, however, it is issue of a
yellow or a red type-flower, then I think we are
justified in suspecting anæmia, for yellow or red
must pass through blue before it can healthily
and with all warrant emerge as white. There are
no leaps in progressive evolution; soundness is
sequence.</p>

<p>Now in no instance, I think, have I been influenced
by the unknown presence of yellow or of
red as I have by that of white and sometimes
of blue flowers. Why should this be: why
should the influence of white be more remarkable
than that of yellow? Is it not probable that in
special cases the human organism is in pronouncedly
sympathetic accord with the organism
of flowers, in some such way as there is sympathetic
attunement between transmitter and receiver
in wireless telegraphy? Is it not possible that
some natures are attuned to blue and white
flowers, and will ignore yellow or red ones, while
other natures are in accord with yellow or red
flowers and are unresponsive to blue and white
ones? I know of a judge at local flower shows
who invariably, and without much demur, gave
first prize to the table decoration containing
scarlet; and if such a decoration was mainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
composed of the Oriental Poppy it secured the
top award without a moment’s hesitation. Is it
not possible that this judge was in sympathetic
attune with scarlet; is it not possible that, were
he to have been blindfolded, and set down in
a field of blue Cornflowers with one red Poppy
hidden away amongst them, he would at once
have been persuaded of the Poppy’s presence?</p>

<p>Thus we end upon a question mark. But let us
not feel abashed. “A man is wise,” says Oliver
Goldsmith, “while he continues in pursuit of
wisdom, but when he once fancies that he has
found the object of his inquiry he then becomes
a fool.” Let us find comfort in this dictum, and
confess that we have discovered scarcely a trace of
that for which we have been inquiring. Cardinal
Newman once observed that men know less of
animals than they do of angels, and I think we may
safely put the flowers by the side of the animals—especially
when our knowledge deals, as it has here
been dealing, with that mysterious subconsciousness
which is the domain of angels. Familiarity is
the much-travelled road to ignorance. We often
deny to familiar things qualities that we stoutly
insist belong to things of which we know really nothing.
The flowers are too obvious, too near to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
us to share the intimacy in which we live with
things hidden and secret. Even we ourselves
suffer in this manner, and we deny to ourselves
qualities we “see” and “know” in what we cannot
see and do not know. What a very curious blend of
contradictions we are! In one and the same breath
we will unduly belaud and unduly belittle ourselves;
but we are no more the restricted creatures
of our fancy than we are the centre and hub of the
universe. Although, manifestly short-sighted, we
stumble about in most awkward fashion, still we
are delicately receptive of subtle, moving influences.
We are instruments of far-reaching powers,
but we look upon ourselves as freer agents than
the case warrants. We imagine we go here and
go there entirely of our own volition, yet if we
were really such lonely automatons as this we
should be immeasurably more stupid than we are.</p>

<p>It must not surprise us, then, if Science some
day convinces us that both in thought and in
action we are moved by many things with which we
now say we have no connection, and that amongst
these things will be found the flowers; it must
not astonish us if such a phrase as “The Call of
the Wild” is possessed of an intrinsic meaning, the
fulness and scope of which we now consider it an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
eccentric folly to admit. There is a wondrous
education in store for us. We are, actually, in
our right place, but we know little of how or
why. When some day our eyes are opened more
widely to the forces that direct our lives, we shall be
humbler than at present. But we shall be happier.
And I venture to predict that few things will help
more materially towards this greater happiness than
will a real and knowing intimacy with the flowers.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">According</span> to authority, there are about 186
species of Rhododendron in the world. The greatest
number of varieties inhabit India and China,
and they are important plants in the Caucasus,
where often—as with <i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>—they
cover the entire side of a mountain. In
Switzerland there are but two varieties, <i>R. ferrugineum</i>
and <i>R. hirsutum</i>, and they are to the Swiss
Alps what the Heather is to the Scottish mountains
(with, however, this difference—the Alps
have also the Heather). They clothe the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
mountain-side with a deep evergreen growth, invading
the lichen-scored rocks and even the pine-forests,
and robing themselves, from mid-June to
mid-July, in such rosy-red attire as fascinates
even the accustomed peasant, causing him almost
as much delight as they cause the stranger.
Indeed, their flowering is a masterpiece of Nature’s
art, and few things are more fitting the sun’s
ascendency and the advent of cowbells upon the
pastures. Wherever on the fields there is a rock,
there shines the rosy shrub against the grey mass,
and the steep slopes glint and glow as they will
do in the autumn when the Bilberry and other
groundlings catch afire. I have met visitors in
disappointment at the smallness of the blossoms,
and inquiring where the large-flowered forms of
our gardens might be found. Certainly, these
plants are not those of the Himalaya, but I
warrant they can boast a glory all their own—one
inspired by its particular circumstance and
surroundings, and vying in that respect with the
glory of the kinsfolk of India or of the Azalea
in Afghanistan. Abundance rather than size is
the keynote of this present splendour; and the
abundance is amazing, giving us a mass of colour
which larger individual flowers could scarcely rival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Wet or fine the glow abides, but in fine weather
its rich brilliance is certainly of summer’s best and
goes far to reconcile us to the lost glories of the
Vernal Gentian. There can be few more satisfying
recollections of early summer days than when,
waist-deep amid the Rhododendrons overgrowing
some ancient rock-fall, one gazed across a rosy
expanse, sparingly broken by grey boulder and
blasted pine and falling away towards the snout
of some sea-green glacier backed by snow-draped
crags and <i>aiguilles</i>, with, in the foreground, on
occasional turfy intervals, groups of orange Arnica
and of <i>Gymnadenia albida</i>, the Small Butterfly
Orchids, close consort of the Rhododendron, whilst
the Swallow-tail and Alpine Clouded-Yellow butterflies
flirted with the blossoms and chased each
other in the thin, clear air and joy-inspiring sunlight.
“The Alpine Rhododendron ... once
gave me,” Mr. George Yeld tells us in his chapter
contributed to the Rev. W. A. B. Coolidge’s “The
Alps in Nature and in History,” “one of the most
effective sights in the flower-world that I can
recall. I came upon it in a late season—acres of
<i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i>, in a forest where the

of the colour—a rich red—the extent of the flower

show, the setting of pines, and the background
of stately ramparts of rock, with an occasional
waterfall, made the scene unique; and the memory
of it is proportionately vivid.” Scarce can such experience
need enlargement along the line of pleasure,
and surely no well-regulated mind will wander in
search of larger-flowered varieties! Such scenes
are satisfaction itself—except that they play upon
some secret human chord, awaken “an obscure
and mystic sense” and waft inquisitive mentality</p>

<p>The Rhododendron is commonly spoken and
written of as the Alpine Rose; but it is a
member of the Heath family, and not of that
family which fable says was created by Bacchus.
This is a ready instance of where popular nomenclature,
without discipline, leads to confusion;
for there is an Alpine Rose (<i>Rosa alpina</i>), a very
lovely rich magenta-coloured Eglantine often
growing cheek-by-jowl with the pseudo <i>Alpenrose</i>
of the Germans. It is quite possible that the
word “Rose” really springs—as in <i>Monte Rosa</i>—from
<i>roisa</i> or <i>roësa</i>, meaning “glacier” in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
ancient patois of the valley of Aosta, and I have
several times seen this more than suggested by
authorities in etymology. The fact remains, however,
that the Rhododendron has become a rose
and has thus obscured to some extent the repute
and worth of the real Alpine Rose. In French,
the Rhododendron, though it is often known as
<i>Rose des Alpes</i>, is sometimes spoken of as <i>Rue des
Alpes</i> and <i>Rosage</i>.</p>

<p>The Rhododendron is the Swiss national flower.
Nor am I sure but that this honour is not borne
almost entirely by <i>R. ferrugineum</i>.  This is far more
widespread than is <i>hirsutum</i>, being far less difficult
in its likes and dislikes. For example, notwithstanding
that <i>hirsutum</i> loves limestone, it shuns
the Jura Mountains, whereas <i>ferrugineum</i> is
common in the Jura, though usually it is shy of
lime. And if the honours really are undivided,
they seem to be won by superior aptness, and the
laurel-wreath rests, I think, upon the more appropriate
brow. For, of the two, <i>ferrugineum</i> best
typifies the Swiss national character—masculine
sturdiness, common-sensed sanity, void of fine
fastidiousness. The whole habit of <i>ferrugineum</i>
is more robust, more rigid, more resistant. It
seeks small clemency; it has, so to speak, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
teeth set, prepared to front the rudest buffets
of Alpine circumstance without a prayer for pity,
and to come up smiling in spite of all. Although,
of course, <i>hirsutum</i> has its own good way of overcoming
severe conditions, it has a greater delicacy
of bearing and does not impress one as being
possessed of its cousin’s rugged nature.</p>

<p>Eugène Rambert, the Swiss poet-alpinist, speaks
of the Rhododendron as being <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<i>la plante alpine par
excellence</i>”</span> and in doing so he probably uses the
word “Alpine” in the same sense in which we
ourselves are here using it, or else perhaps he
refers to the plant as, for the most part, it is
resident in Switzerland. For on the Italian face
of the Alps the Rhododendron descends, as around
Lugano, to the plains. Mr. Stuart Thompson,
who has made a special study of altitude in connection
with the mountain flora, says in his
“Alpine Plants of Europe” that <i>R. ferrugineum</i>
“ascends to 8,800 feet in Valais, to at least
8,200 feet in the Maritime Alps, and descends
into the plain in Tessin by Lago Maggiore (with
<i>R. hirsutum</i>), and by Lake Wallenstadt, and it is
occasionally found as a glacier relic in turbaries in
the woods of the Swiss plateau.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson, by mentioning the fact of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
remains of Rhododendron being found in peat
deposits on the plains, gives us a glimpse of this
plant slowly retreating up the mountains with the
glaciers. And yet, on the south side of the Alps,
it is still to be found upon the plains! This is
one of the mysteries of Alpine plant-life, and one
for which I have seen no satisfactory theory.
<i>Gentiana verna</i> shows us, I believe, the same
seeming inconsistency, descending to the sea-coast
in Ireland, yet rarely, if ever, found below 1,300 feet
in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Like the English Dog Rose—and this, perhaps,
is its greatest likeness to a Rose—the Rhododendron
develops galls (Oak-apples or Robin’s Pincushions,
as they are called in England) upon its
leaves. Some of these are produced by insects
and some by a fungus (<i>Exobasidium rhododendri</i>),
the latter gall being yellow, and turning pink or
rose on the sunny side. The leaves and flowers
are used in infusion for rheumatism; also as an
ingredient of Swiss tea. This shrub, too, is the
food-plant of one of the handsomest of Alpine
butterflies, <i>Colias Palæno</i>, a Clouded-Yellow—anything
but clouded, though it lives where
clouds are born, for with its clear citron wings
boldly bordered with jet-black and rimmed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
tender rose, it is a bright, true child of high
altitudes.</p>

<p>Nor should the Rhododendron be forgotten as a
subject for our gardens. When raised from layers
or from seed, it takes quite kindly to our climate.
Indeed, the plants at “Floraire,” M. Henry Correvon’s
charming garden near Geneva, come from
England—a fact that will sound much in line
with that of living at Brighton and receiving one’s
fish from London! This anomaly, in the case of
the Rhododendron, is due to the great difficulty of
acclimatising the plant to the Swiss plains. When,
however, it has once been acclimatised in England
it will transplant to Switzerland with the greatest
success. I cannot remember ever to have seen in
Switzerland a successfully transplanted native plant
of Rhododendron, even though, as is frequently the
case around mountain hotels, it has been a question
of moving it only some few yards from where it was
growing wild. These wild plants have a strong
objection to being tamed. But in England’s humid
climate it is quite easy to cultivate, and if fields are
to be added to our rockworks the Rhododendron
must have a place in them—a place around the
solitary rocks, a place with the Daphne and the
shrubby Honeysuckles.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>With what fecundity of resource Nature marshals
her forces; with what amazing ingenuity she passes
to her goal! As if to show her wayward child
how academic strictness in one straight line is not
the road to greatest success, she takes a thousand
ways to reach one and the same end, causing
extremes and opposites in method to give a
common high result. And this she does on every
hand, and in all of her domains. In the world
with which we are now dealing—the plant-world—she
is particularly rich in ways and means. See
how, for example, some flowers need the wind
to assist them to propagate their kind, and note
the many ways such flowers have of courting the
wind’s assistance; see how others need the bees
and flies to busy themselves about them, and note
the many ways such have of attracting the attentions
of bees and flies; see how some will call
in a beetle to eat his way to their hearts, whilst
others will just hob-nob together, independent of
any intermediary. See, again, how some plants
bury their roots in the earth for sustenance, whilst
others, with like object, will bury them in the air;
see, too, how some will climb by the help of their
thorns, whilst others will do so by the aid of
tendrils, or of rootlets, or of adhering fingers. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
admirably efficient way of achieving a purpose
does not preclude the possibility of there being
a score or more other and equally efficient ways of
achieving the same purpose. One species of
Orange-tree may carry its seed in the core of its
fruit, whilst another may carry it in a special
exterior annexe; or one species of Mangrove-tree
may breathe by means of its leaves, whilst another
may do so by means of tube-like organs thrown
up through the soft mud.</p>

<p>It seems strange we should be so strictly narrow
in our outlook, surrounded as we are by so much
clearly demonstrated resourcefulness; it seems
strange that all day long our dogmatic finger
should point here, then there, and the presumptuous
cry go up, “<i>This</i> is the only right and
proper way!” It seems strange: for it is thus
a person is a savage in our eyes if, instead of
wearing ornaments in his ears, he wears them in
his nose and lips. To be sure, we are improving
in this respect, for at one time we readily burnt
people who had another way of doing things.
But there is still vast room for progress. And,
surely, it is no fond trick of the imagination to
believe that an appreciable amount of this room
will gradually be appropriated to progress made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
through Nature Study. For Nature is too far-sighted
to be dogmatic, too capable to be
academic; she leaves an illimitable margin for
what is right, incidentally giving a complete exposition
of the truth of our much employed, but
much neglected adage, “All roads lead to Rome.”</p>

<p>Now, in these two Swiss Rhododendrons there
is excellent occasion for noting two very different
means of offering highly effective resistance to
a common foe. The foe is drought—the drought
of the hot, ungenerous, porous moraine, and of
the rapid, rocky, sun-baked, wind-swept slope.
Mountain circumstance, such as is affected for the
most part by these Rhododendrons, is the outcome
of comparatively recent disturbance; soil is
in the forming, and what there is of it but thinly
coats a tumbled bed of crevassed rocks and
boulders. Casual observation may lead visitors
to suppose the Swiss Alpine climate to be by
no means devoid of moisture and to be liable
at all seasons to its fair share of damp, all-enveloping
cloud and fog, and to storms of snow
and rain. And casual observation will be right.
But no section of the globe’s face is more
thoroughly and more promptly drained than that
of the Alps, and a “deluge” of rain is like so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
much water on a duck’s back. Hence, an incomparable
system of drainage is one of the prime
disabilities against which Alpine vegetation has
to contend. And the Rhododendrons meet this
disability in two ways—<i>ferrugineum</i> with hard
leaves, varnished above, and felted and resinous
beneath; <i>hirsutum</i> with softer, pliant leaves fringed
by hairs. Thus do both fence ably the evil of too
rapid evaporation; thus do both, by their diverse
methods, give to the student</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Amid</span>
the brilliant floral gathering which crowds
into the arena of the Alps upon the blazoned entry
of July, one marks no sign of the fair and frail
St. Bruno’s Lily. Nor is this as it should not be.
Dainty to the point of extreme delicacy, this
flower of Paradise is justly of a season more
restrained, and one should not heap regrets upon
its absence from so flamboyant a concourse as this
present. The rich-blue Bell Gentian is likewise
absent from the gay and jostling crowd, having at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
last vanished from the shadier nooks where, in
fond persistency, it has been continuing the cult
of spring. But these two precious field-flowers
form, possibly, the sum of June’s distinguished
absentees.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Why fret about them if to-day be sweet!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And, surely, to-day is as sweet as ever yesterday
was! The glory of the Bistort is not yet on the
wane, and to it the tall Buttercup has wedded its
lustre, and <i>Ranunculus aconitifolius</i>, the Fair Maid
of France; consequently, the moister meadows are
a knee-deep wealth of pink, yellow, and white.
On the drier fields, too, the rich blue and mauve
expanses of Salvia and Geranium are now reinforced
by the crowded blue bells of <i>Campanula
rhomboidalis</i>, and hosts of the mauve-blossomed
Scabious; while upon the slopes the now declining
Biscutella and Strawberry-flowered Potentilla
have for new companions <i>Hieracium alpinum</i>,
<i>Hypochœris maculata</i>, <i>Crepis aurea</i>, <i>Campanula
barbata</i>, and <i>C. Scheuchzeri</i>, the tall lemon-yellow
<i>Hypochœris uniflora</i>, and the lilac <i>Gentiana campestris</i>.
The tall blue and tall white <i>Phyteuma
betonicæfolium</i>, and the blue, round-headed <i>P.
orbiculare</i> are everywhere, and have been joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by the tall blue <i>P. Micheli</i> and the little blue
<i>P. hemisphæricum</i> of onion-like leaves. The
Orchids, also everywhere, are still in full beauty,
their numbers having been swelled by the arrival
of <i>Gymnadenia albida</i>.  The stately <i>Veratrum
album</i> is in flower, companioning the equally
stately Yellow Gentian, to which, in habit and
foliage, though not in blossom, it bears a strong
resemblance. The Arnica, also, is coming into
bloom: the tall, red-brown Martagon Lily is fast
filling out its buds; the Yellow Rattle and
Anthyllis are ubiquitous; the graceful Thesium,
with sprays of olive-coloured stems and leaves and
tiny white stars (and ugly English name of
Bastard Toadflax), is looking its daintiest; and
hosts of Ox-eyed Marguerites and pink Umbelliferæ
top the meadows far and wide. On the rough
banks and edges of the fields, or on the rocks that
so often crop up in these pastures, <i>Saponaria
ocymoides</i>, <i>Helianthemum alpestre</i>, <i>Calamintha
alpina</i>, <i>Veronica saxatilis</i>, and <i>Silene rupestris</i>
add respectively their bright pink, orange-yellow,
mauve, blue, and white abundance to the radiance
of the field-flowers proper. In “the grassy hollow
that holds the bubbling well-spring,” <i>Myosotis
palustris</i> is opening its myriad blue eyes; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Bartsia lingers by “the flower-lit stream” and is
joined by the tiny bright blue <i>Gentiana nivalis</i>,
here and there showing its rarer white form;
whilst up upon the mountain-sides, backing and
dominating the whole of this crowded, gay array,
the Rhododendron is fast putting forth its red,
amazing fulness.</p>

<p>If June be reckoned as a millionaire, then surely
July must also, and with the additional prefix
“multi”! “It is with flowers as with men,” says
Major Reginald Rankin in “The Royal Ordering
of Gardens,” and “Providence is on the side of
big battalions.” And, of a truth, this is so in
these fields; bigger battalions it would indeed be
hard to find. Is there not here some striking
suggestion of an element in ultimate beauty—that
of an harmonious brotherhood? One certainly
seems to catch a glimpse of that economic state
where individuality is general rather than particular;
where personality is absorbed by the
mass, and beauty is conspicuous only in the whole;
where, so to speak, the red neckties of leadership
do not flare out in designed and conscious isolation.
Among themselves plants have their likes
and dislikes. It is well known that, for example,
certain flowers are only found in the company of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Corn, and it is said that in the kitchen-garden the
Radish simply detests the Thyme. But here, on
these meadows, all trace of discord seems lost in
one great accord, and the plants, both great and
small, blue-blooded and plebeian,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“A social commerce hold, and firm support</div>
       <div class="verse">The full adjusted harmony of things.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And what pageantry it all is; what consummate
pageantry! “The flowers are at their Bacchanals!”
The Old Mother, unlike many other parents, is not
outdistanced by her children. Though man be
loath to admit it, she holds the lead, and sets him
both pace and tune. What are his pageants
beside the pageantry of this his age-full parent?
He summons up his past for glory, and, rightly
or wrongly, sees magnificence only in what he has
been; but his old mother, as here on these fairy
fields, seeks naught further than the present.
Were it not well that he read in this the lesson:
“Nature must once more become his home, as it
is the home of the animals and angels”? Were
it not well that he should shift his ground and thus
amend his outlook? Scarcely does it befit him to
brag about</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Nature’s fair, fruitless, aimless world</div>

<p>“Fruitless, aimless world”? Why, willy-nilly,
Nature moulds <i>him</i>—even by allowing him to
think he is moulding <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>Behold these meadows! Will he take them and
mould them to anything better than they are?
No, he certainly will not. Will he give them an
aim higher than they possess at present? Possibly.
There is, however, only one way by which
he may succeed: let him unbend, and let him
gather these meadows closer to his heart and
understanding: let him transport what he can of
them to his parks and gardens. But let him not
for one moment imagine that by so doing he is
“moulding” them; for, indubitably, it is they
who will be moulding him.</p>

<p>And for this reason: Alpine fields are such
superlatively true art that he cannot but find in
them, as in all true art, a common ground of
interest, fellowship, happiness, advancement; “a
means”—as Tolstoi says of true art—“of union
among men, joining them together in the same
feelings”—feelings that must ameliorate, must
refine.</p>

<p>We are now nearing the dread but necessary
moment when the scythe will be laying low the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
flowers; but ere the arrival of this careful, callous
friend of the cows, we have a few more hours in
which to cast another greedy look around. The
Bistort and Buttercup, Orchid and tall Rampion,
have become, or are fast becoming, dingy and seed-full,
but there are several handsome and interesting
newcomers; and many of these subjects, such
as the Martagon Lily and Field Gentian, which
at the commencement of the month had only a
bloom or two open here and there, are now at
perfection. The red <i>Centaurea uniflora</i> is a vivid
object among the grasses: a “distinct advance,”
as nurserymen would say, upon <i>C. scabiosa</i>, our
common Hard-heads or Knobweed, blooming beside
it. The sturdy Brown Gentian (<i>Gentiana
purpurea</i>) and its near relation, the cream-coloured
or greenish-yellow <i>G. punctata</i>, are conspicuous
objects, and <i>Hieracium aurantiacum</i>, the fiery,
orange-red Hawkweed or Grimm the Collier,
burns as a jewel among them. <i>Astrantia major</i>,
the Great Masterwort, unique and charming—more
particularly when its flower-heads take on
their truly Alpine tint of rosy magenta—is here
with its little brother, <i>A. minor</i>, pale and fragile,
perhaps from its habit of living in shadier places
than <i>major</i>.  The Campanulas are glorious, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the lilac pyramidal heads of <i>C. spicata</i> are striking
“bits of colour” where the grass is sparser.
So also are the lovely deep-blue, pea-like masses
of <i>Vicia onobrychioides</i>, associating with Rampion,
Arnica, and Martagon or Turk’s-cap Lily. <i>Dianthus
superbus</i> spreads a lace-like mantle of pink
and white over the shadier portions of the fields
by the forest’s edge; and <i>D. sylvestris</i> is a glory
of flesh-pink upon the hotter slopes by the rocks.
<i>Aconitum Napellus</i>, blue Monkshood or <i>Char de
Venus</i>, is not hereabouts as on the higher pastures;
neither are the yellow and orange pea-like
<i>Orobus luteus</i> and that curious Bellflower, <i>Campanula
thyrsoides</i>, with its stumpy hollow stem
surmounted by a close-set mass of washed-out
yellow flowers; nor is the handsome large-flowered
yellow Foxglove (<i>Digitalis ambigua</i>) so plentiful
in the Jura Mountains and in other limestone
districts. But <i>Thalictrum aquilegifolium</i>, most
seductive of the Meadowrues, raises its soft-lilac
or cream-white plumes—often beside the majestic
cream-white plumes of <i>Spiræa Aruncus</i>, Queen
of the Fields—in luxuriant hollows where dwell
bushes of Alpine Eglantine and Honeysuckle. In
these rich, grassy hollows, too, are noble plants of
the sticky, yellow <i>Salvia glutinosa</i>, or Jupiter’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Distaff; the tall mauve <i>Mulgedium alpinum</i>, the
<i>Laitue des Alpes</i> or Alpine Lettuce of the French;
the equally tall red <i>Adenostyles albifrons</i>; and the
Lesser Foxglove (<i>Digitalis lutea</i>), with dark, shiny
foliage and packed spikes of pale yellow blossoms.
The orange-yellow Leopard’s-Bane, <i>Senecio Doronicum</i>,
and the pink and white <i>Valeriana montana</i>,
are upon the dry, turfy banks; and down upon
the lower slopes, among the shrubs or out in the
sun-baked open, is a brilliant concourse of yellow
<i>Ononis natrix</i>, pink <i>O. rotundifolia</i> (here and there
white in form), blue, Thrift-like <i>Jasione montana</i>,
tall, rich-blue, open-flowered <i>Campanula persicifolia</i>,
and pure yellow, red-stamened <i>Verbascum
phlomoides</i>, finest of the Mulleins. Intense-blue
clumps of Hyssop enliven the hot, shaly spaces;
and here, too, is <i>Linum tenuifolium</i>, a Flax with
delicate lilac flowers; the Golden Thistle (<i>Carlina
vulgaris</i>), which, with the white <i>C. acaulis</i>, is so
useful for winter decoration: the exquisite pink
and white rambling Vetch, <i>Coronilla varia</i>; and
<i>Dianthus sylvestris</i> and <i>D. Carthusianorum</i> are
wellnigh everywhere in pink and red abundance—the
latter sometimes running to so deep and fiery
a shade as to be found worthy of the additional
name of <i>atrorubens</i>.</p>

<p>Truly, this is a “sun-kissed land of plenty,” with
July blazoned in tones of utmost triumph! Yet
harmony, restraint, refinement, have not in any
way been sacrificed. Our sense of this is so acute
that when we return to the plains, the gardens
and their gorgeous burdens are apt to jar upon
us, as will vulgarity or a flagrant want of taste.</p>

French Marigolds, Asters and Sweet-Williams,
and the flaming beds of Petunias, Salvias, and
Geraniums. Mark how gross seems all this
“cultivation” after the Alpine wildness. You
are at once constrained to ask yourself. What
is there derogatory in wildness if to be cultivated
is to be as these garden flowers? You see at
once more clearly than possibly you ever saw
before that, after all, refinement is largely a
relative quantity, and that even the Rose, Dean
Hole’s “Queen Rosa,” can appear coarse after you
have spent a season with the Gentian.</p>

<p>And perhaps it is this feeling that can account
in some measure for our habit of isolating all
Alpines upon rockworks. Perhaps it prompts us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to treat them with special deference; and though
we will not, cannot deny the Balsam, or the
Tropeolum, or the Cactus Dahlia our loudest
acclamations; though we keep for these and suchlike
products of cultivation a proud place in our
affections, hailing them as familiars allied most
intimately to our ordinary, worldly natures,—though,
I say, we hold this grosser, gaudier
vegetation with loving tenacity to our hearts, yet
is our rarer self in instant touch with these Alpine
wild-flowers, and, as it were, conducts them
honourably to a shrine apart.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The Aster and the Edelweiss are now in bloom
above us, and we are “list’ning with nice distant
ears” to the chime of the cattle-bells, wind-wafted
from the higher pastures, half wishing it were our
business to climb. We could, if we would, be
again with the youth of the year; for one of the
delightful possibilities of Alpine residence is to be
able to follow spring and summer well into the
heart of autumn. But this year we dare not;
our task is to watch these half-way fields to the
end of the floral seasons. Nor is our lot a hard
one. Though flower-land hereabouts is now nearly
a dream of yesterday, yet have we much that can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
still hold us to the spot, enchanted and instructed;
though for some few days past the fields have seen
their best, and are now for the most part spacious
park-like pleasaunces of yellowish-green, yet have
we still the famous setting of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse indent-2">“... dreaming mountains,</div>
       <div class="verse">Lifted from the world together”;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet have we still the vast, irreproachable arena
which, there is no gainsaying, has helped towards
the deep and lasting impression we have gathered
from the meadows.</p>

<p>Over yonder, towering high above the Grand
St. Bernard road, and reflected snow for snow
and precipice for precipice in the placid waters of
the lake, is the Grand Combin, one of the noblest
units of “those great constellations of snow-peaks
which Nature has massed, in splendid and prodigal
confusion,” in this part of Switzerland; away, at
the end of the Val Ferret, are the white and
graceful lines of the Grand Golliaz, flanked on the
near side by the <i>massif</i> of Saleinaz, and on the
further side by the Groupe du Grand Saint-Bernard;
while, immediately above us, suffused
with the red of the flowering Rhododendron, are the
steep and rocky masses of the Breyaz, the Clocher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
d’Arpette, and the Catogne, that curious mountain
that can be seen from Vevey and Lausanne, a
sugarloaf-like cone, blocking the very centre of the
Rhône Valley.</p>

<p>What a happy thing it is that in this neighbourhood
the mountains are reminiscent of nothing
except their own giant individualities. How
vexing when this is otherwise—when, I mean,
there is a lion rock, or a weeping woman, or a
head of Napoleon in the landscape; as when Mark
Twain discovered that one of the aiguilles flanking
Mont Blanc “took the shapely, clean-cut form of
a rabbit’s head.” At Château d’Oex, for instance,
the outline of the Gummfluh is a really creditable
profile likeness of the great Gladstone with his
collar, and that of the Rubli next door presents
the profile of O’Connell, the Irish patriot. Apart
from the damage inflicted upon the landscape by
the intrusion of party politics, such huge examples
of Nature’s unconscious incursions into portraiture,
when once they have made themselves plain,
become a distressing obsession; and especially is
this so for the artist who attempts to paint these
mountains without producing a puzzle-picture.
Fortunately, there are some places which up to
the present seem to know nothing of such untoward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
resemblances in their surroundings; fortunately,
there are some beauty-spots which have
so far escaped the eye with the disturbing gift
of “seeing forms” in clouds and trees and whatnot;
and Champex is one such. At Champex we may
rest and dream without fear of our indulgence
degenerating into a nightmare.</p>

<p>But this is not such a season for dreaming as
was the spring; we are far more of the world than
we were when the Vernal Gentian, that “turquoise
lighting a ground of green,” was heralding all that
is now so rapidly falling before the scythe. Yet it
must not be supposed that these fields have lost all
power to nourish or stimulate the imagination.
The configuration and nature of the ground are so
varied that haymaking is a more lengthy and
irregular operation than it is upon the plains. We
have only to turn to the ousy land where the
Grass-of-Parnassus<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> opens its white, green-veined,
Ranunculus-like flowers among the large, rich-blue
bells of <i>Campanula Scheuchzeri</i> and the tall, paler
blue spikes of <i>Polemonium cœruleum</i>, the well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Jacob’s Ladder of our gardens; or to the
drier stretches where the Heather is just tinting
its olive-green branches with a suspicion of rose,
and the Rampions, Arnica, Hieracium, and Brown
Gentian are mingling with the warm grey, feathery
seed-heads of <i>Anemone sulphurea</i>.  Here we find
the flowers and butterflies as numerous and as
gay as ever; here among the grasses is <i>Banagna
Atrata</i>, the little dull-black moth with white-tipped
wings, seeking sanctuary from the devastating
work of the reapers; <i>Zygœna carniolica</i>,
one of the most distinct and fascinating of the
bright Burnet butterflies, a stranger to England,
greedily absorbed upon the flowers of the
Scabious; numberless Fritillaries, speeding hither
and thither, their burnished pearl-backed wings
flashing in the sunlight,—here, in fact, we have
summer at its height, uninjured, undisturbed—a
place, as Walden was, where we may “transact
some private business with the fewest obstacles.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The name “Grass-of-Parnassus” often occasions wonder; for the
plant, a member of the St. John’s Wort tribe, shows no affinity to
grass. Anne Pratt, in her celebrated book on English Wild-flowers,
says the name possibly arises from the fact that the plant “is as
common as the very grass itself on Mount Parnassus.”</p>

<p>The fields are bald, the slopes are shorn or
ragged, and the grass that is left standing is looking
for the most part very “seedy.” The golden-flowered,
pink-flowered, and white-flowered Sedums
are blossoming upon the field-rocks; the Willow-Herb
is lighting up the rough and stony places
with its rosy-red spikes; the Bilberry’s fruit is
turning a dusty blue and its foliage here and there
is showing promise of a fiery autumn; the Rhododendron
is developing on its thick leaves the
brilliant red excrescences which, like the hairy, red
excrescences on our common Dog Rose, are said
to be so efficacious in cases of rheumatism; the
dainty, black-bordered Damon “Blue” butterfly
flits from the Heather to stray blooms of Arnica
and Astrantia, and many a brown Erebia is
hampered and tired out by a horde of red parasites
beneath its wings. Summer, in fact, is leaning
obviously towards autumn, and we can expect
nothing more of note from these meadows, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
a lovely wealth of magenta-pink Colchicum or
“Autumn Crocus” in August and September.</p>

<p>When visitors, arriving at this late stage in
Flora’s fortunes, see my coloured transcripts of the
fields in May and June, they think that I, like any
prejudiced enthusiast, have falsified my evidence.
They find the pictures <i>ben trovato</i>, and they say:
“How beautiful! but of course you have used
an artist’s licence?” They look at the shaven or
dingy fields, then again at my paintings, and they
tell me plainly they think they can prove an <i>alibi</i>
for the flowers in spring, or, at any rate, for a greater
part of those I have depicted. And I—I can only
assure them their case has “no leg to stand upon.”
I can only insist that if they knew of my despair
when seated with my picture among the flowers in
spring—my despair of ever being able to give
more than an inkling of the glorious riot that
surrounded me—they would suspect the truth; and
that if next year they came here and witnessed for
themselves, then, when again they looked upon
my pictures, they would curl the lip and speak of
insufficiency.</p>

<p>I am aware that it is, of course, not possible for
many of the late-coming visitors to leave the
home shores earlier in the year: business is business,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
schooling is schooling, fixed holidays are fixed
holidays. But without doubt there are many
who could be more timely, if they chose—many
who in June are crowding at Montreux, or Geneva,
or Lucerne, thinking it too early for the mountains.
For there are many who are persuaded that
spring is a dangerous period in the Alps. They
will tell you in all seriousness, as they have told
me, that it is in spring in the Alps that the
microbes re-awaken after their winter’s sleep, and
that, therefore, it is better to be in the towns; in
the towns, mark you, where the microbes, more
monstrous and numerous, rarely if ever, slumber—or,
if they do so, it is with one eye open!</p>

<p>Then there are those who, because they know
nothing about flowers, are convinced that the Alps
for them would be a place of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i></span> in the spring
when high excursions are not yet possible. But
what a mistake it is to imagine we must be botanists
or gardeners in order to feel a full joy in these
fields! No particular knowledge is required to
appreciate them; there is no peremptory need to
know by name a Geranium from an Orchid, a
Pansy from a Cauliflower. Indeed, I am not at all
sure but that the “plain man” or woman does not
really enjoy them more than does the plant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> specialist.
For joy comes mostly fuller with the
broader moments of life, and analysis is apt to
injure the soul-stirring harmony of things. And
as the merely emotional value of these fields is
immense, their appeal is quite as general as it is
particular, perhaps even more so; for the emotional
qualities of anything are more acceptable to the
man-in-the-street than are its precise and reasoned
quantities. And, just as there are far fewer
musicians within the ranks of executants than
outside, so there are more flower-lovers and lovers
of floral beauty outside the ranks of botany and
gardening than there are within. Thus amid
these fields the plain, expansive man or woman
need be in no fear of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ennui</i>.
<i>Ennui!</i></span>—why, even
when the visitors do come and the flowers have
seen their best, there is no <i>ennui</i>! Then how
much more inspiring must it be when the fields
are in their hey-day, not their hay-day!</p>

<p>It is, then, upon all and sundry that I urge the
claims of the Alps from the middle of May to
mid-July; it is to the merest tyro in plant-lore, as
well as to the botanical and gardening enthusiast,
that I say, and say in all persuasiveness of conviction:
“You know not what you miss by failing</p>

<p class="noindent">you know not what you lose by neglecting the call

<p>Go where you will—Champex alone is not the
Alpine throne of Flora; she reigns superbly to
right and left, from Neuchatel to Valais, from
Tessin to Geneva—go where you will amid the
Alps and you will find fields that shall enchant
you, rejuvenating your spirit and causing the
“knapsack of custom,” full of “city estimates of
great and small, wise and foolish,” to slip from
your back. The plains of the world are the
better for the mountains of the world, and in no
respect more so than when the mountains are
a-flower.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span>
the only flower to bless, and bless again,
the passage of the scythe over the damp slopes and
fields of Alpine Switzerland is <i>Colchicum autumnale</i>,
the so-called Autumn Crocus; for, from the close-cropped
grass it pushes up its blossoms when all
other field-growth has done its utmost. What
sorry plight it would be in if the tall yellowing
plants and grasses were still left standing, cumbering
the ground with a dense and matted vegetation!
It would be smothered; or, at best, it
would have a fearsome struggle to see the sky.
One wonders how it contrived when, in ages past,
these meadows went uncut. One wonders if the
active appetites of browsing animals sufficed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
clear the ground in anticipation of its scheduled
advent; and, should this not have been the case,
one wonders if at that time it were an inhabitant
of such fields as these, or whether it were denizened
in more propitious places?</p>

<p>For as soon as the haymakers have gone their
way, this lovely flower begins its apparition. Often,
even within a week of the haymakers’ visit, hundreds
upon hundreds of its creamy-white pointed
buds will show as if by magic above the close turf;
and after a day or two more of sunshine, the fields
will have regained what is almost springtime life
and gaiety. Many of us were sighing whilst we
watched the scythe’s disastrous progress, and were
saying that all was over and it was time to be
moving plainwards; but those of us who knew,
said: “Wait—wait! These fields have yet another
trump-card to play!”</p>

<p class="noindent">A week ago we looked for colour to the autumn-infected
bush and tree, and now quite suddenly,
over the tired fields, there steals a pale magenta
glow, almost as the spring-glow spread by the
Bird’s-Eye or Mealy Primrose; a week ago we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
lived and dreamed upon the past, and now we are
startled back to the present by this, “the last that
the damp earth yields”—last but not least—last
but in some ways equal to the first.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>This Colchicum receives, in spring, in summer,
and in autumn, as much general attention as any
plant in Alpine or sub-Alpine vegetation. In
spring and summer the cluster of rich-green
Lily-like leaves attracts the eye and raises the
curiosity and expectation of even the casual
observer, especially when this observer notices
what he almost invariably takes to be a flower-bud
nestling in the heart of the leaves; for if there is
one family of plants which the world worships
more than another, it is the Lily family. And
this Autumn Crocus is very commonly taken for
a Lily—a Lily soon to burst into rare and glorious
bloom.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i233.jpg" id="i233.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i233.jpg"
        alt="" width="600" height="404" />
  <div class="caption"><i>ROSA ALPINA</i>, the thornless Alpine Eglantine.</div>
</div>

<p>But it is not the flower-bud our casual observer
sees; it is the seed-head. The plant blooms, leafless,
in the autumn; its seed-vessel is tucked away
for the winter a foot or more beneath the surface
of the ground, to rise with the leaves in the spring,
and to ripen with the leaves in the summer. Yet,
if our casual friend is wrong as regards the nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of the seed-head in the spring, he is right as regards
the nature of the leaves; though he is again wrong
in the autumn, and this time as regards the nature
of the flower. For the Colchicum is not a Crocus.
Although its magenta-pink blossom is of Crocus-like
form, it has six stamens and three styles with
which the humble-bee may busy himself; whereas
the Crocus has but three stamens and one style.
There does exist a purple autumnal Crocus—<i>Crocus
nudiflorus</i>, indigenous to England, and with the
same habit of flowering and producing its seed as
the Colchicum’s—but this and the Colchicum belong
to different natural orders.</p>

<p>The Colchicum is a member of the Lily family,
and, as such, is related to some of the most distinguished
members of the flower-world. For this
reason, too, it is allied to such diverse plants as
the Herb Paris, the Lily-of-the-Valley, the
Asparagus, and the Spiked Star of Bethlehem
(<i>Ornithogalum pyrenaicum</i>), an indigenous English
plant whose young spring shoots are sold and
eaten in Bath as “French” Asparagus. It has
also as blood-relation the Onion and the Garlic,
which, according to Professor G. S. Boulger, “were
given divine honours by the ancient Egyptians”;
also the curious Butcher’s Broom or Knee Holly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and the real Star of Bethlehem (<i>Ornithogalum
umbellatum</i>), whose bulbs in Palestine are cooked
and eaten.</p>

<p>But if the bulbs and young shoots of some
members of this singularly “mixed” family are
esteemed as table delicacies, not so the bulbs and
shoots of the Colchicum, for these are poisonous
to a high degree—in fact, the whole of the plant
may be labelled “Dangerous.” Although the
flower is less poisonous than the seed and the
bulb, yet many a time I have seen bees which
had sought refuge from the night or from rough
and stormy weather, lying prone and stark within
the lovely pink chalices, victims of a misplaced
confidence. The seed contains a deadly alkaloid
(colchicin), used especially in cases of gout. Where
the plant grows in quantities it depreciates the
value of the meadows; for the cattle, wiser in their
generation than the bees, give it a wide berth at all
seasons. And it is no easy subject to drive from
the fields when once it has gained firm footing.
It buries its dark chestnut-coloured, scaly bulb at
least a foot down in the peaty soil, necessitating
the cutting of a good-sized hole before it can be
extirpated. Hence, if it is growing as it almost
invariably does, in fairly close-packed abundance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the meadow will have to be deep-dug all over;
and such radical measure as this the peasants
as a rule refuse to take, contenting themselves
with pulling up the leaf and stalk before the fields
are cut, or with sorting them out from the new-mown
hay.</p>

<p>As a plant indigenous to the British Isles it
is very local, though widely distributed. Saffron
Walden, in Essex, is named after it, and it is
found in Ireland and in some parts of Scotland,
especially upon the damp meadows of limestone
districts.</p>

<p>The name Colchicum, of Greek origin, is said
to be derived from Colchis, a province in Asia
famous for poisonous herbs. In England, besides
the names of Autumn Crocus and Meadow
Saffron (<i>Crocus sativus</i> is really the true Saffron
Crocus), its flower is known in some parts of
the country as Naked Boy, and in Dorset as
Naked Lucy, an allusion, of course, to it being
bare of leaves. In France its popular names are
seemingly more various, and besides the general
one of <i>Colchique</i>, it has those of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Veilleuse</i>,
<i>Veillotte</i>, <i>Violon</i>, <i>Vache</i>,</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Tue-chien</i></span>; while in the
patois of Marseilles it is known as <i>Bramo-Vaco</i>,
and in that of Gascony as <i>Safra dès prats</i>.   In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Germany its best-known appellation is <i>Herbst-Zeitlose</i>.</p>

<p>There is an Alpine form of the Meadow Saffron—<i>Colchicum
alpinum</i>—and this is to be found
upon the fields from an altitude of about 3,000
feet to some 4,500 feet, according to M. Henry
Correvon, and from about 1,800 feet to some
6,000 feet, according to Professor Flahault. Mr.
Newell Arber calls it a rare plant “sometimes
found in Canton Tessin and the Valais,” but my
own experience is that it is local rather than
rare, and that it is fairly frequent in Canton
Valais, especially in non-limestone regions. Its
habit is the same as that of <i>autumnale</i>: two to
three upright leaves surrounding the fruit in the
spring, and the flowers appearing “naked” in
autumn upon “dim fields fresh with blooming
dew.” But the leaves are narrower than those
of <i>autumnale</i>, and the flower is smaller, daintier,
more <i>petite</i>, with a suspicion of canary-yellow
tinting the stem, which, in <i>autumnale</i>, is white
or creamy-white.</p>

<p>I have sometimes noted the two—<i>autumnale</i>
and <i>alpinum</i>—hob-nobbing upon the same slope
or field. Such fraternity exists, for instance, quite
near to the snug little village of Trient, beneath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the Col de la Forclaz and the Col de Balme,
and again on a rich grassy slope by the lake
of Champex; and where this occurs the difference
between the two flowers is manifest. <i>Colchicum
alpinum</i> may be only the Alpine form of
<i>autumnale</i>, but if it is, it is, I believe, a fixed
form—a form which, unlike some Alpine forms
of lowland flowers (such as, for example, <i>Anthyllis
vulneraria</i>), steadfastly maintains its highland
character when transported to the gardens
of the plain. For if instability exists, why should
we find upon the fields where both do congregate,
no intermediate forms marking the passage of
<i>autumnale</i> to <i>alpinum</i> and vice versa? I believe
it to be as constant as is <i>Gentiana brachyphylla</i>,
although this is said to be but a high Alpine
form of <i>G. verna</i>.  I believe it to be as “constant
as the northern star.”</p>

such a flower as the Autumn Crocus; is it
justified? I imagine it is not. I venture even
to say I am sure it is not.</p>

<p>Here is a flower that is exceptional. It defies
the general rule, the usual sequence of life for
flowers. It reverses the customary order of
events and, so to speak, turns day into night.
And it does so with the utmost felicity. Its
well-being is ideal, for it shows perfect adaptation
to its circumstance. What, then, have we?
“What rumour of what mystery?” Can it be
a rumour of disability through blindness? Is it
a rumour of the mystery of justice? Is it, that
is to say, a rumour of “injustice”? I think not;
nay, I am sure not. It is, if you ask me, a
rumour of that wide and many-sided efficiency
to which we refer when we declare: “There are
more ways than one of killing a cat.”</p>

<p>The fault is quite a common one with us. We
fall into it each time we talk of animals—the
“poor, dumb animals.” Wherefore poor? Wherefore
dumb? Man, noisily verbose, condescends
to commiserate with anything less noisy or less
verbose than himself. To him, an absence of
capacity for a volubility matching his own marks
unhappiness. What, he asks, would not a cow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
give for humanity’s gift of the gab? Anything
short of a garrulous chatterbox of a mouse must
be a wretched mouse!</p>

<p>How contorted a view to take when every
living thing (except, perhaps, man) is capable of
adequate communion with its kind, and when
that which is adequate is happy! The method
of communication may not be man’s method; he
may not understand a sound of it, and there may
even be no sound for him to hear; nevertheless
there is language clear and effective—perhaps
more clear and more effective than his own. Who
shall say the language of the ant or the bee is
not more developed and more efficient than either
English or Chinese? Efficiency does not ultimately
lie in complexity, neither does it ultimately
depend upon noise.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that a horse, unless he has
better sense, feels the profoundest pity for his
garrulous master, and counts him among the most
unhappy of his acquaintances. A lion’s roar or
a bat’s squeak may contain a wealth of information
such as it would take Man an hour’s hard talking
to translate; and both may indicate a world of
happiness.</p>

<p>Man, the rowdiest animal in Creation, is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the most conceited. He is for ever thanking his
stars he is not as others are; and this enables
him to misplace a vast amount of pity. I warrant
the poor, dumb, grunting pig is perfectly happy—far
happier than the most glib of human orators;
and far more to the point. Poor, dumb animals?
Why, what a poor, talkative creature is man!
And how unmindful of his own proverb about
“little pitchers”!</p>

<p>Eyes are not everything, ears are not everything,
tongues are not everything. Neither are eyes, ears,
and tongues together everything. There is sight
without eyes, hearing without ears, and speech without
tongues. Science can prove it, when Science
chooses. For there is sense behind our senses—sense
as unerring as any declared by our senses.
I have, indeed, a shrewd suspicion that we may
be poor beside the ant; and I have a somewhat
uncomfortable feeling that in some ways we may
be paupers beside poor, blind <i>Colchicum autumnale</i>.</p>

bowing beneath the weight of their fiery fruit;
the long-tailed and the crested titmouse hunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
in tuneful bands from sombre Pine to yellowing

wand, passes restless athwart the ripe scene—and,
hey, presto! the fields have all the closeness of
the fields in springtime, and are studded with
countless rosy stars of the Autumn Crocus, just as,
in the first days of the year, they are studded with
the myriad rosy stars of <i>Bulbocodium vernum</i>, near

in it; something of a becoming consideration for
old age. It is obviously an autumnal pink—a pink
which falls without ado into the glorious colour-scheme
of Nature’s kindling funeral-pyre. It has
something of the spirit of the colouring surrounding
a Chinese burial. There is sadness, if you
will; but there is gladness, whether you will or
not. Chopin’s famous Funeral March might have
been inspired by autumn’s pale-magenta “Crocus.”</p>

<p class="ac">ALPINE FIELDS FOR ENGLAND</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“En multipliant la beauté, en donnant au monde des humbles le
sens de la sincère beauté, vous lui aurez fait la plus exquise et
peut-être la plus utile des charités.”—<span class="smcap">Pierre Vignot.</span></p></div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> title of this
chapter will come as a shock to
some, and they will think it an insult to, and an
outrage upon, Nature’s existing efforts for English
meadows. In my previous volume, “Alpine
Flowers and Gardens,” I ventured some mild
wonder “that more attempts are not made in
England to create Alpine pastures,” and I added:
“Alpine rockworks we have in hundreds, but a
stretch of meadow-land sown or planted with
Alpine field-flowers seems as yet to be but rarely
attempted.” And of this mild wonder some of my
critics fell foul, and I was told that I seemed “to
forget the peculiar beauty of English pasture as it
is, with its buttercups, cowslips, and orchis, daisies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and red sorrel.” But let me reassure these nervous
champions of what is “made in England.” I will
be the last to slight or traduce the exquisite
restraint of our typical home-fields, or to despise
the spirit that can appreciate their charm and place
it higher than the charm of alien fields. The
inhabitants of a country are intimately affected
by the country’s fields, and an Englishman is far
more a product of his meadows than even he
would suppose. His sturdy advocacy of a floral
sufficiency which stops at Dandelions and Buttercups
is part proof of this. Reciprocity in Nature
is a very subtle and far-reaching law, and man owes
much of his temperament and habit of mind to the
landscape and its constituent parts. In this way,
undoubtedly, the Englishman is largely indebted
to the comparative taciturnity of his fields. Far
be from me, then, to under-rate their value and
their charm.</p>

<p>And yet, may I not think that this value and
charm can perhaps be augmented? We love and
revel in our native meadows as they are—their
Buttercups, their Dandelions, their Daisies, and
their Grasses; how much greater would not the
love and revel be if here and there a generous
measure of Swiss mountain-wealth were added?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Such measure would be no violent innovation; it
would be a natural amplification of the hereditary
trend of our instinct for the beautiful. Swiss
mountain-fields are not like Japanese gardens: our
nature responds to them without affectation, for in
them our mind</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Doth straight its own resemblance find.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is all very well for confirmed materialists to
say we have not to study this side of the question
because it is too fanciful; it is not to be dismissed
by calling us mystics. Fancy has led men to much
that is now inseparable from their understanding,
and the mystic has stood for ages upon spots where
Science is only now confidently placing her foot.
Really and truly, too, the æsthetic aspect of life
comes under the head of the utilitarian, and it
matters more than much that is deemed material.
Ruskin thought that “a wood of English trees is
of more value to humanity than a Bank;” but this
savours of too dogmatic thinking, and of the
extreme dream of a specialist enthusiast. Without
drawing invidious comparisons between the utilities
of life, we may say that the woods and fields have
an importance all their own, and that, by increasing
their beauty, we increase their importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not for one instant think that in Maytime
we could improve upon the weighty wealth of
Hawthorn set amid knee-deep meadows of Buttercups
and Parsnips; for the rare witchery of it all
is unmistakable. I would leave it as it stands:
British <i>par excellence</i>, unrivalled for quiet prosperity,
for unique felicity. Nor would I tamper
with the wealth of Primrose copse, or attempt to
meddle with the woods of Bluebells, Daffodils, and
Foxgloves. To do any such thing would be purest
sacrilege—and a wild conceit into the bargain!
No, no; there is much, very much in Britain’s
countryside that rightly stands in the front rank
of Nature’s happiest creations, and it were mad
impertinence to think to oust it or to improve it
by inept additions. But these front-rank marvels
are not everywhere. Many is the spot that might
reasonably be bettered; many the wayside field,
copse, bank, or railway-cutting that would repay
us for a little help; and it is in such places (<i>pax</i>,
O Farmer! have I not gone round to avoid
treading on your property?)—it is with regard to
such places that I do suggest we might take a
leaf from Nature’s Alpine book.</p>

    middle of July.</div>
</div>

<p>But why, some will ask—why interfere with our
indigenous field-flowers, and thus with our pure-bred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
English fields; why cause anything so
individual to become mongrel? And this sounds
plausible until we examine the pedigree of some of
our “indigenous” flowers, and find that they are
“doubtful natives,” and owe their presence among
us to the Roman invader or are “escapes from
cultivation.” Precedent is therefore on our side.
Then why should not we of this twentieth century
do as did the Romans for Britain—only with a
little more method, not trusting to the seed
of Alpine field-flowers coming inadvertently to
England in our portmanteaux, our boots, or our
hair? We ought not to be afraid of the inevitable
trend of things towards a more general,
more common aspect. We may well nurse some
particular individuality so long as it is eminently
useful, but at the same time we should leave
our judgment open with regard to accretion, or,
as the dictionary calls it, “increase by natural
growth.” Insularity is a disappearing quantity,
and there surely will and must come a time when
we shall chiefly hear of it from books of ancient
history and scandalous <i>Mémoires</i>.</p>

<p>But if for the present we cannot bring ourselves
to continue systematically the work of the Romans,
let us at least take in hand some of the field-plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
we have already with us, and induce them to
become more general and abundant. Even in that
way we should approach to something of Alpine
prodigality; for there is quite a goodly number
of British plants among the colour-giving subjects
of an Alpine meadow. There is, for instance,
<i>Geranium sylvaticum</i> (the rose or blue-mauve
Wood Crane’s-bill), rare, and found mostly upon
pastures in the north; or there is <i>Astrantia
major</i> (the pinky-green-and-white Masterwort), an
“escape,” near Ludlow and Malvern; or <i>Phyteuma
spicata</i> (the cream-coloured Rampion), found only
in Sussex; or <i>Salvia pratensis</i> (the rich-blue
Meadow Clary), scarce, and confined to fields in
Kent, Oxfordshire, and Cornwall; or <i>Polemonium
cœruleum</i> (the blue Jacob’s Ladder or Greek
Valerian), rare, and confined to the north of
England. Why should not such as these be
brought from out their hiding and be induced
to people propitious places in a more abundant
way?</p>

<p>No sooner, however, does “sweet reasonableness”
begin to dawn upon our imaginations, and
we commence to take kindly to our idea, than
we are confronted by the irate farmer—hasty and
nervous lest we and our “weeds” have designs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
upon his domain—upbraiding us for daring to
suggest such palpably bad farming. But we have
no intent to meddle with <i>his</i> meadows. Yet if we
had, what answer can we make him? Is it of any
use for us to point to Swiss experience of flowery
pastures, telling him that the finest cheeses—those
of Gruyère and Emmenthal—are made on the
middle or lower “alpen,” and that, in fact, they
come from fields which are literally crammed with
lovely flowering plants? Is it of any use assuring
him that cows fed on the comparatively flowerless
fields of Fully, for example, opposite Martigny in
the Rhône Valley, give not only less, but less rich
milk than those fed on the fields of Chemin,
Chables, or Champex, and that, whenever possible,
the flowerless hay goes to the horses? Is it of any
use pointing out these facts to our scandalised
friend? Possibly not. Possibly he will retort:
“Necessity makes high use of just whatsoever is
within reach; other lands other ways; circumstance
creates ideals.” And quite possibly he will be
right.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>But whatever may be said in disparagement of
the introduction of Alpine plants into England’s
fields in general, little or no objection can be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to fields of such plants as adjuncts to Alpine rock-gardens,
or as embellishments to park and
pleasaunce. Here we are in a domain which is
“orthodoxly” regarded as æsthetic, and not as
practical or utilitarian. And, after all, we had best
begin by the thin end of the wedge—we had
best commence with these flower-fields as a
“luxury”; afterwards—as is quite likely—we may
be able to chronicle “escapes” into the general
scheme of the countryside.</p>

<p>I can think of no feature of the Alpine landscape
which could add so much charm and interest
to English Alpine gardens as an Alpine meadow,
and it is no mean matter for surprise that this
feature has not so far claimed the attention it
most assuredly merits. Moreover, an Alpine rock-garden
shorn of its meadow-setting is less than
a picture devoid of its frame. Can any one who
knows the Alps imagine what they and their rock-flora
would be without the fields and grassy slopes?
Would there be the same widespread and immediate
interest? It is inconceivable, for these
fields and slopes are, as it were, the exquisitely
sumptuous hall through which, amazed and wondering,
we pass to gain the rudeness and refinement
of Alpine asceticism proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there is another and, I think, a crying
reason for the creation of fields to supplement our
rockworks; we garden at present, for the most part,
as if all Alpines were rock-plants, whereas quite an
important percentage are purely field-flowers. It
will be said that in England’s comparatively
luxurious climate the grasses would overwhelm
the Alpines and that, therefore, it is only wise
to place these latter out of harm’s way.  But,
although there certainly are some subjects of an
Alpine meadow which could scarcely be expected
to grapple successfully with English conditions,
yet there is a whole host that could do so, especially
if care were taken to choose suitable grasses and
to exclude certain English weeds (the Field Bindweed,
for example, or the Plantain). In advocating
any such adoption as the present, we must not
be so unphilosophic as to be sweeping and dogmatic;
we must be quick to recognise that such
subjects of the Alpine grass-lands as <i>Viola calcarata</i>
and <i>Gentiana verna</i>, <i>excisa</i>, and <i>nivalis</i> shall of
necessity be ushered to the rockwork when they
arrive in our island home. But, frankly, I believe
there are many of these plants which would
be altogether grateful to find themselves in a field
rather than in a garden-border or upon a rockery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Will any one deny that a plant which, in a wild,
free state, invariably chooses to dwell upon the
meadows is not more at home there than when
robbed of such pressing, self-sought company?
Will any one deny that, for instance, <i>Campanula
rhomboidalis</i>, <i>Paradisia Liliastrum</i>, <i>Salvia pratensis</i>,
<i>Narcissus poeticus</i>, <i>Veratrum album</i>, or <i>Phyteuma
betonicifolium</i> are not infinitely happier when growing
together in close company with grasses than
when standing in select isolation upon the rockery
or the garden-border?</p>

<p>Possibly it will be argued that these field-plants
show themselves so much better on the border or
the rockwork. But do they? Does Colchicum,
for example, look better against the brown earth of
a border than upon a thick-set carpet of green?
Does <i>Veronica spicata</i> ever look better than when
seen upon the fields of the Alps? Is it possible
that the Meadow-Orchids are not at their best
among the grasses? For my own part, I find
many of these plants look thin and lonesome when
carefully set apart “to do themselves full justice.”
In nature they are items in a rich reciprocal
scheme of intimacy, and in this assuredly is their
truest happiness; therefore, as part of this scheme
they must certainly be seen at their best. Snatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
from their social birthright and perched in grandeur
upon a rockwork, they cannot but have wistful
thoughts of lost companionship.</p>

<p>Owners of rockworks may protest that they do
all they possibly can for their captives, treating
them as tenderly as they would any beautiful bird
in a cage; they may protest that their captives are
fed and watered most carefully and know little or
nothing of the struggle for existence which rules
upon Alpine meadows. And this is all very right
and proper as far as it goes; but very many of
these plants could be treated even more kindly and
properly by allowing them something of their
ancestral habits. That which untrammelled Nature
decrees for her offspring is inevitably best, and we
should take practical note of it where possible.
We ourselves are rebels and, as modern instance
shows, are very conscious of it in our more rational
moments, crying aloud in a hazy, frightened way,
that we must “get back to Nature!” Why, then,
compel rebellion in so many a thing we admire?
Such compulsory estrangement from what is
natural is a sorry sort of kindness. Let us put
back the field-flowers into the fields—or, at any
rate, as many as we may.</p>

<p>To a great number of flower-lovers this would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
be a much simpler matter than the building and
tending of rockworks (though, of course, the ideal
should be for the field to companion or environ the
rockery). It would be less complicated, and it
would not entail such a variety of specialist knowledge.
Many of a kind, and each kind robust and,
for the most part, ordinary—that should be the
rule among the plants for our Alpine meadow.
Fractious, exigent rarities would naturally not be
welcome. Fields are perhaps loveliest when planned
upon broad lines. There is no need to make
extraordinary efforts to find sports and forms; no
need to do more than Nature does—here and there
a white or porcelain-grey <i>Campanula rhomboidalis</i>,
here and there a pale-pink <i>Geranium sylvaticum</i>,
here and there a white <i>Salvia pratensis</i>, here and
there a white <i>Colchicum autumnale</i>.  Forms and
sports and vagaries are all very well, but in these
meadows it is the type-plant which counts. A
field of Salvia, Campanula, and Geranium is blue
and mauve; that is the general effect, and variation
from it rarely counts in the colour-scheme.
Eccentricity we may keep for the proud eminence
of our rockworks.</p>

the clean, invigorating air which goes so far to
form the joy exhaled of Alpine meadows; if we
may not lay on the wonderful atmosphere of the
Alps as we may the ozone from the seaside,—we
can at least take the flowers, those brilliant children
of the Alpine ether, and thus help materially
towards mountain purity in our parks and gardens.
Some of the gaiety might be lost in the process—some
of that intensity of colouring which steals
over the very grass as it climbs the mountain-side
and encroaches upon the kingdom of the Rhododendron.
<i>Astrantia major</i> might lose its rosy-magenta
blush and assume a more or less livid
green-white; Lychnis, Geranium, and Salvia might
lack something of their Alpine lustre; a certain
mildness might reign generally in the place of
mountain briskness; but, on the whole, the loss
to the flowers would be small and the gain to the
garden or the landscape immense, and we should
find that we had annexed much of the charm and
joy of Alpine days—</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> such as wish
to set about creating an Alpine
meadow, either as an attractive feature of their
pleasure-grounds or—which is more to the point—as
a completing part of their rock-garden, let
me at once say that this volume is no detailed
<i>vade mecum</i>, and that, for the cultural requirements
of the plants mentioned, recourse must be had to
the many good books already dealing with that
phase of the subject. All that is pretended here is
to point the way to a much-neglected path in
Alpine circumstance and to attempt to arouse the

the Alps. But, before doing so, let me impress
upon the reader that, not only will it be no Alpine
field in the popular sense, but that we may
occasionally have to descend even to the fields of
the Swiss plain in order to find one or two subjects
which we can use with advantage to enrich our
scheme—plants such as the Star of Bethlehem and
<i>Scilla bifolia</i>.  The Swiss plains lie high when
judged by English standards; rarely, if ever, do
they fall below some 1,200 feet.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>The field I have in my mind’s eye as I write
these lines is one which, “with its early and
exquisite diversities of form and colour”—to quote
again from Dean Hole’s little book—“is a new
and large delight.” It is one in which the bulbs,
hundreds upon hundreds in number and about five
in kind, burst into life with the grass in the first
days of spring. White and purple <i>Crocus vernus</i>,
rosy Crocus-like <i>Bulbocodium vernum</i>, and yellow
Gagea are the first-comers, quickly followed by the
golden Daffodil (<i>Narcissus Pseudo-narcissus</i>), the
bright blue <i>Scilla bifolia</i>, the green-and-white Star
of Bethlehem (<i>Ornithogalum umbellatum</i>) and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
handsome large-flowered relative, <i>O. nutans</i>.  Then,
following close upon the Violet, Cowslip, and Oxlip,
come the earlier of the Orchids—<i>Orchis Morio</i>,
<i>O. mascula</i>, and <i>O. maculata</i>.  A little later <i>Myosotis
sylvestris</i> spreads a blue haze over the field,
aiding most admirably the lively pink of <i>Orchis
(Gymnadenia) conopsea</i>, and rendering the appearance
of <i>Paradisia Liliastrum</i>, the paper-white
Paradise Lily, daintier than ever. And now I
see a glorious multitude of Pheasant-eye Narcissus
(<i>Narcissus poeticus</i>), with here and there a tall,
deep blue or purple Columbine. Lemon-yellow
<i>Biscutella lævigata</i>, too, clear-blue <i>Linum alpinum</i>,
and white <i>Potentilla rupestris</i> blend their blossoms
to produce a lovely harmony in true spring-like
key. <i>Muscari comosum</i> throws up its curious blue-purple
spikes, over-topped by the white sprays of
<i>Anthericum Liliago</i>.  And in the moister part of
the meadow I see great colonies of <i>Ranunculus
aconitifolius</i> and the yellow Globe-Flower (<i>Trollius
europæus</i>) sown in most happy manner with our
Ragged-Robin (<i>Lychnis Flos-cuculi</i>), presently to
be joined by bright-pink regiments of Bistort or
Snakeweed (<i>Polygonum Bistorta</i>). And then, when
<i>Centaurea montana</i>, accompanied by <i>Geranium
sylvaticum</i>, <i>Salvia pratensis</i>, <i>Lychnis dioica</i> (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Red Catchfly), <i>Silene Cucubalus</i> (the Bladder
Campion), and <i>Polemonium cæruleum</i> usher in the
summer, the field is rich indeed in blue, mauve,
lilac, red, and pink, with a distinct leaning towards
blue, mauve, and lilac. And these colours seem to
hold their own to the end. White may come with
the Ox-eye Daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanthemum</i>)
and the many Umbelliferæ; red may come with
brilliant <i>Centaurea uniflora</i> and crimson <i>C. nigra</i>,
the common Hard-head; yellow may come with
tall <i>Hypochœris uniflora</i> and such Buttercups
as <i>Ranunculus bulbosus</i> and <i>R. acris</i>, but blue and
mauve and lilac seem always to predominate; for
the Rampions (<i>Phyteuma betonicæfolium</i> and
<i>P. orbiculare</i>) and Campanulas (<i>C. rotundifolia</i>
and <i>C. rhomboidalis</i>) join forces with the Meadow
Clary and the Wood Crane’s-bill and linger on
until the Martagon Lily is gone out of flower and
the field stands more than ready for the scythe.
Indeed, long after the scythe has done its worst,
and <i>Colchicum autumnale</i> is a thing of yesterday,
and autumn’s fires have paled, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“The few late flowers have moisture in the eye,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">those flowers, or the major portion of those flowers,
will be blue and mauve and lilac—Campanula,
Geranium, and Salvia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>A field such as this is a garden in itself, and a
revelation, surely, for those who know only our
home-fields. And it will be noted that in such a
field there need be no destruction of effective
English field-flowers. Indeed, the addition of
Alpine wealth to our home-fields ought not to
oust any but rank invaders, such as the Plantain,
the Nettle, or the Bindweed, or other “volunteers,”
as Californians picturesquely call them. Our
Buttercups, Daisies, Orchids, and Red Sorrel
should be secure; Dandelions and Ox-eye Marguerites
can, and should, continue their reign as of
yore; for all of these are constituents of meadows
in the Alps. Thus, if we create meadows to companion
our rockworks, we should be growing many
an Alpine which at present we do not allow among
our Alpines; and in this way, if in no other, our
Alpine gardens would be far more complete, far
more representative, and, therefore, far more worthy
the name.</p>

<p>No; because a flower is already common in
England is no necessary reason why it should
be taboo in any Alpine field we may create in
England. Indeed, such common things as the
Marsh Marigold (<i>Caltha palustris</i>), the two Buttercups
(<i>Ranunculus acris</i> and <i>R. bulbosus</i>) and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Bladder Campion (<i>Silene Cucubalus</i>) are most
precious. Who that has seen the Marsh Marigold
pencilling with golden lines the course of some
mountain rivulet through the spring fields, and
lying, with <i>Primula farinosa</i>, a brilliant mass, in
some juicy hollow; or the two Buttercups, blending
with acres of <i>Ranunculus aconitifolius</i>, and forming
a filmy sea of yellow and white; or slopes packed
with the Bladder Campion and the tall Rampion
(<i>Phyteuma betonicæfolium</i>), a perfect picture of
grey-white and blue,—who that has seen these
common flowers thus growing but has not vowed
rarity to be no essential passport to the ranks of
beauty? I remember once—it was at Montroc,
near the Col des Montets—passing over a meadow-slope
of Bladder Campion and Rampion, with just
a sprinkling of that other and closely allied Campion,
<i>Silene nutans</i> (the Nottingham Catchfly),
and the effect so fascinated me, as to send up
these Campions considerably in my esteem, as
subjects with decorative possibilities of which I
had not dreamed.</p>

<p>Objection may possibly be taken to the large
area required for the creation of an Alpine meadow
in comparison with its short duration as “a thing
of beauty.” It will perhaps be objected that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
field must be mown; that the ripening growth
cannot be allowed “to lie in cold obstruction and
to rot”; that, from July to the end of the year,
the field will be a stubbly place of emptiness,
whereas our rockwork will bear a continual round
of interest until the coming of the frost. And
this complaint would be reasonable if we were
dealing with just an English meadow set with
certain Alpine plants to make it gayer than is its
habit. But we are not—not, that is to say, if we
are contemplating the meadow as a companioning
feature of our rock-garden. A typical Alpine
meadow is full of “accident”; there is nothing of
the billiard-table about its eventful surface. Palpably,
it must have been the scene of utmost violence
before Nature decked it out with verdure. Steep
depressions; wide gullies; abrupt limits, falling
suddenly away in a grassless, rocky bank to a
rough path below,—such “accidents” as these
break its even tenor. Rocks, grey and lichen-flecked,
crop up from it here and there—rocks
hurled in some past fury from the heights above
or borne from afar upon the breast of some ancient
glacier; for an Alpine field, more often than not,
is a delightful combination of rockwork and pasture.
Hence there is accommodation for a much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
wider range of plant-life than in a meadow run
upon English lines, and the season of interest is,
therefore, as long-lived as that of any part of our
garden. “Accident,” indeed, is the constant characteristic
of it, and floral variety the natural corollary.
When the hay has been made upon the richer
portions of it, the poorer or more broken parts and
the rocks continue to abound in blossom, giving
us such things as the Thalictrums, Monkshoods,
Peas, Veronicas, Pinks, Saxifrages, Sempervivums,
and Sedums.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>GENTIANA CAMPESTRIS</i> and <i>GENTIANA

</div>

<p>When, therefore, we choose the parcel of ground
to be transformed into a Swiss mountain meadow,
we should not be dismayed if its surface is already
more than undulating; we should not summon
assistance to level it up and smooth it out. We
are not proposing to make a croquet-lawn, but
are supposed to be inspired by Nature in one of
her wild, “irresponsible” moods. Violence, however,
should depend upon size. If we are dealing
with several acres, we can afford to be grand
with regard to “accident”; but if the land at
our disposal is, perhaps, half an acre, irregularity
should be to scale; for to be artistic we should
avoid extravagance.</p>

<p>Rocks, as has been said, are an almost essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
feature of an Alpine field. The ground should
rise towards them and should be of a poorer
nature than where the grass is to be really
meadowy; for upon the poorer ground we shall
be dependent for many colonies of gay and
interesting plants which would be out of place,
even they could exist, among the thicker grasses.
Here we may count upon brilliance long after
the Geranium and its field-consorts have been
mown down—brilliance afforded by such subjects
as <i>Ononis natrix</i>, <i>Linum tenuifolium</i>, <i>L. alpinum</i>,
<i>Jasione montana</i>, <i>Campanula spicata</i>, <i>C. barbata</i>,
<i>C. persicifolia</i>, <i>Trifolium alpinum</i>, <i>Eryngium
alpinum</i>, <i>Vicia onobrychioides</i>, <i>Veronica urticæfolia</i>,
<i>Lathyrus heterophyllus</i>, <i>Anthyllis vulneraria</i>,
<i>Carduus defloratus</i>, <i>Verbascum phlomoides</i>, and
<i>Onobrychis viciæfolia</i>, the rosy Sainfoin or “wholesome
hay,” for which the ass is said to bray.</p>

<p>The rocks employed ought, in greater part,
to be of a “generous” nature, not hard and unresponsive.
They should if possible be even soft
(as rocks go) and somewhat liable to disintegration—rocks
upon which, with a little preliminary
encouragement, Sedums, Dianthus, and Sempervivums
can take root. They ought not to be
built up to form what is generally recognised as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
a rockwork, but should be large, massive, and
sparsely set, cropping up from the ground haphazard
and as if their greater bulk were beneath
the soil. Grass should be encouraged to grow
about them, even upon them in places; and <i>Poa
alpina, forma vivipara</i> is a suitable, as well as
a most interesting, grass for this purpose. The
Alpine Clover, too (<i>Trefolium alpinum</i>), may
well be encouraged to spread around the base of
these rocks and over the ground that slopes up
to them. With its large, loose, rosy flower-heads,
sometimes white or lilac, it is an ever-welcome
June visitor, especially where it luxuriates;
as, for instance, at Le Planet, below the French
side of the Col de Balme.</p>

<p>I have said that the rocks ought, <i>in greater
part</i>, to be of a “generous” nature; and I have
said this because a hard and unresponsive rock
here and there would not be out of place.
Although quantity equally with quality is the
predominant note in Alpine floral circumstance,
it is not an invariable rule, and something of
barrenness only adds to the scene of plenty.
Moreover, a cold, bare rock with just one cleft
in it where some single tuft of Dianthus, or of
<i>Veronica saxatilis</i>, for instance, can cling is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a very precious object amid a surrounding exuberance
of blossom. Often in English rock-gardens
there is too little unoccupied rock.
Ubiquity of plant life in this respect is not so
artistic as when there is a modicum of reticence;
nor is it so truthful.</p>

<p>Another by no means inappropriate feature is
that which can be lent by shrubs or bushes; not
as hedges, for Switzerland, when compared with
England, may be said to be devoid of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse indent-1_5">“... Little lines</div>
       <div class="verse">Of sportive wood run wild.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">characteristic commonplaces in England, where, it
is said, they cover one and a half million acres, they
are rare in Switzerland; or, at any rate, as Leslie
Stephen remarked, “those detestable parallelograms,
which cut up English scenery with their
hedgerows, are sternly confined to the valley.” And
in the valley they are comparatively scarce, and lack
the charm pertaining to the English hedgerow.</p>

<p>No; if our field is to have an Alpine allure,
hedges must be tabu. But a negligent grouping
around the rocks or upon the outskirts of the
field, of such bushes as <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i>,
<i>Rosa alpina</i>, <i>Berberis vulgaris</i>, <i>Rosa pomifera</i>,
<i>Juniperus nana</i>, <i>Sambucus racemosa</i>, and the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Honeysuckles, <i>Lonicera alpigena</i> and <i>L. nigra</i>,
would not only enhance the effect and interest, but
would tally with Nature as she generally rules
in the Alps. Nor would the Bird Cherry (<i>Prunus
avium</i>), if kept in bush form, be out of place.
This lovely spring-flowering tree, treated as a
hedgerow subject on the plateau at the back of
Lausanne, is an arresting object in the fields
around Chamonix at the end of May. And
here, with the shade and shelter of such bushes,
may come the nobly plumed Goat’s Beard (<i>Spiræa
Aruncus</i>), the mauve and the cream-plumed
<i>Thalictrum aquilegifolium</i>, the deep-blue <i>Aconitum
napellus</i>, the violet-blue <i>A. paniculatum</i>, the
creamy-white <i>A. Lycoctonum</i>, the rosy <i>Adenostyles
albifrons</i>, the ever-graceful Solomon’s Seal (<i>Polygonatum
verticillatum</i>), the blue-mauve <i>Mulgedium
alpinum</i>, the red-brown <i>Lilium Martagon</i>,
the brilliant orange <i>L. croceum</i>, the pale-yellow
<i>Salvia glutinosa</i>, the golden <i>Lathyrus luteus</i>, the
pink and feathery <i>Dianthus superbus</i>, the Fennel-like
<i>Meum athamanticum</i>, the distinctive Umbellifer,
<i>Laserpitium latifolium</i>, besides such Orchids
as <i>Epipactis atrorubens</i>, <i>E. latifolia</i>, <i>Cephalanthera
ensifolia</i>, <i>C. pallens</i>, <i>C. rubra</i>, and <i>Habenaria
(Plantanthera) chlorantha
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></i>.</p>

<p>If we are to have some kind of boundary-mark
to our field, let it be by preference a low,
mortarless wall of fairly large rough stones or
pieces of rock built up with earth—a sort of
rockwork wall. These walls may be met with
almost anywhere in the Swiss mountains, and
are frequently composed of fragments of rock
which at one time and another have been strewn
about the fields by rockfalls or avalanches. They
often become the home of brilliant masses of
such plants as <i>Saponaria ocymoides</i>, <i>Silene rupestris</i>,
<i>Gypsophila repens</i>, <i>Helianthemum vulgare</i>,
<i>Arabis alpina</i>, <i>Calamintha alpina</i>, and <i>Cerastium
alpinum</i>, thus adding considerably to the gaiety
and charm of the fields—a gaiety and charm
which in the case of these walls lasts well into
the autumn.</p>

<p>Some difficulty may be experienced over the
grass which is to accompany the meadow-flowers.
Indeed, it is an objection usually raised whenever
I have broached the subject of Alpine fields to
gardening enthusiasts; they fear that English
meadow-grass would overwhelm the stranger-flowers
by leaving them no room to breathe. But
is not this obstacle one rather of hasty imagining
than of reality? We are not proposing to put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<i>Viola alpina</i>, <i>Gentiana verna</i>, or the Soldanella
into the field. Moreover, there are grasses and
grasses; and I believe a very suitable selection
could be made from any of the leading seed-merchants.
I should suggest that the ground be
sown with smaller, daintier grasses, and <i>only after
the flowering-plants have become more or less
established</i>; and I imagine that if this were done—and
a sharp eye kept for the ever-ready invasion
by native weeds—the imported field-flowers would
hold their own.</p>

<p>An interesting fact in connection with Alpine
fields—one that should not be copied in England—is
the tendency of what is usually shade-loving
vegetation to creep out into the sunlight. In spite
of the intensity and power of the sun’s rays, even
certain ferns, such as <i>Aspidium Lonchitis</i>, the
Holly-fern, and <i>Polystichum Filix-mas</i>, seem to
think nothing of basking upon the hottest slopes.
True, their roots are generally sheltered by rock
and stone, but the fronds look the sun squarely
in the face; and yet, what can possibly be fresher
and more engaging than, for instance, the masses
of Parsley-fern to be met with in the stony places
of the granitic Alps? Wood-Sorrel, too, will come
out into the open; so will the little Alpine London
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Pride (<i>Saxifraga cuneifolia</i>) and the little Yellow
Violet; so, also, will the May Lily or False Lily-of-the-Valley
(<i>Smilacina bifolia</i>). In England,
<i>Astrantia major</i>, when found, is said to seek the
partial shade of copse and spinny, but here on
these Alpine fields it is in the full sunshine—and
looking very much the better for such boldness.
It is as though the higher plants climb, the less
they fear the light, extraordinarily searching though
this latter be; it is as though they revel in the
purity, and, casting retirement to the winds, take
on a new and healthier joy in life.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>ASTRANTIA MAJOR</i>, <i>A. MINOR</i>, and the
    Apollo butterfly.</div>
</div>

<p>There is, perhaps, just one other matter calling
for special attention: the grouping of colours.
Alpine fields own immense variety in this regard.
Some will be almost of uniform tint, while others
are of a bewildering, diverse blend. One will be
blue and white (<i>Campanula rhomboidalis</i> and Ox-eye
Daisy); another will be blue and red (<i>Salvia
pratensis</i> and <i>Lychnis diocia</i>); another, yellow and
pink (the Globe-Flower and the Bistort); while
another will be a close, irregular mixture of
some score or more of colours, with no one in
particular predominating. Although Nature in
her wildness is almost invariably “happy,” it is
only natural that some of her results should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
happier than others; and it is well to take note
of the best she can do. Personally, I find her
happiest when she keeps her palette simple, painting
broadly, and not indulging in Segantini-like
technique. And surely her simpler floral harmonies
are among the perpetual delights of the Alps,
and incapable of being bettered by even the
most fancifully fastidious of “post-impressionists”?
What could be more charming than, for instance,
the simple combination of pale yellow and paper-white,
or of rosy-pink and rich mauve when, as is
quite usual, Biscutella and Cerastium, or <i>Saponaria
ocymoides</i> and <i>Calamintha alpina</i> are luxuriating
around and among the rocks; or when blue Myosotis
and white Paradise Lily, or canary-coloured Crepis
and sky-blue Veronica, or white Potentilla and
rosy-mauve Geranium, or vivid orange Arnica and
lilac Orchids are blooming in important numbers
side by side among the grasses? I do not advocate
formality—the formality depicted in Andrew
Marvell’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“See how the flowers, as at parade,</div>
       <div class="verse">Under their colours stand display’d”:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which suggests the careful horrors of bedding-out.
A certain negligence is imperative; we may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
studious as regards effect, but we must not show
it. The question of colour-grouping is certainly
one worthy of careful consideration; for if gardening
is not exactly an art that “doth mend Nature,”
it is, at all events, a selective art, picking and
choosing of Nature’s best and bringing this together
within special confines, there to show in
a series of close-knit <i>tableaux</i> that which wild
Nature spreads out far and wide among much
that, æsthetically, is of secondary “happiness.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Pen-</span> and
brush-craft pale their ineffectual fires
before the beauty of Alpine grass-lands, and flawful
and halting has been the manner of presenting
my subject; but I hope a sufficient glimpse of its
fascination and importance will have been caught
to raise enthusiasm to the point of making amends
for a neglectful past. Whatever may be the verdict
upon the question of introducing Swiss floral
wealth to our meadows generally, perhaps enough
has been said to make it plain that very many of
the mountain field-flowers cry aloud to be treated
<i>as field-flowers</i> in every Alpine garden where there
is scope for, and pretensions to, completeness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
And I believe that the cry will be answered. I
believe that the value of the fields, in the economy
of Alpine plant-life, has only to be placed earnestly
before conscientious gardeners and lovers of
flowers for it to meet with immediate and becoming
diligence. I believe it will be seen that
a rockwork is not the first, last, and only home
we may make for Alpines in England, and that
it is as unlovely as it is unjust to tar all of them
with one and the same brush and think that,
because they are called Alpines, they must necessarily
be given a perch dominating the rest of the
garden. I therefore believe that one more of our
cherished conventionalities will soon be relegated
to the “Valhalla of bad taste.”</p>

<p>We “are still looking through a kaleidoscope
at ever-changing views,” and “the eternal verities”
have as yet by no means been sounded to their
bases. If “Badsworth” can find sufficient sanction
to talk like this of auction bridge, with how much
more reason may it not be said of gardening and
the cult of Nature? It is doubtful if we have
reached much that is final in anything; certainly
not in gardening. Gardening—or flower-gardening,
since that is the department with which we
are here dealing—flower-gardening is something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
more than the mere growing of blossoms to please,
something more than the mere forming of a living
herbarium, something more than the mere creation
or collecting of “novelties” for the sole sake of
novelty; there is something deeper and more difficult
to talk about than that—something none the
less real because largely indefinable. As earnest,
thinking gardeners, our views and sentiments are
not limited to a mere toying with the soil and
with attractive vegetation. We are not children—though
we ought to be, and are. I mean, we do
not garden—we do not build Alpine rockworks
and plant them with gay flowers quite so irresponsibly
as children build mud-castles and stick
them over with coloured oddments. There is a
significant profundity in the meanest of our efforts—even
in the building of mud-castles; and in the
maturer effort of gardening it is only natural that
this should be of richer meaning.</p>

<p>Gardening is a saving grace in any nation. It
would be invidious to name examples; enough
to say that nations with marked propensities for
gardening figure prominently in past and present
history. Such nations, though “insurgent sons,”
are necessarily less so than they would otherwise be;
for they live nearer to the truth of things, nearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
to Nature. Gardening touches well-springs of being,
and helps materially towards the moral advancement
of a race. It is affected by the same fundamental
“psychic” influence as is painting, or,
indeed, any other of our kindred enthusiasms. In
it we are striving, not so much to express Nature,
as to express ourselves through Nature; not so
much to transcribe Nature line for line, as to
translate—as creatures who consider ourselves so
much apart from, so much above, Nature—what
we think we feel, perhaps see, and almost certainly
dream in her. And far be it from me to aver
that we are not striving even to supplant Nature—seemingly
a mad ambition, for in the end, do as
we will, Nature, and nothing but Nature, has found
expression. Yet it is not quite as mad an ambition
as a first inspection would lead us to suppose.
Indeed, it is good, if not actually great; for it is
the biggest of the many bunches of carrots dangling
in front of the human animal’s nose, inducing
him to keep “pegging away.”</p>

<p>Independent and original as we may consider
ourselves, we yet from time to time have to turn
and take our cue from Nature. She, after all,
is the source at which we must refresh our jaded
imaginations; she is the storehouse from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
we must draw new blood, new energy, new ideas;
she instigates our ideals and holds the cause and
means for inspiration; without her promptings,
in fact, we should go bankrupt. In the Buddhist
“Sankhya-Karika” we read how, “like a <i>danseuse</i>
who retires from the dance after she has shown
herself to the crowd, Nature retires after she has
shown herself in all her splendour to the soul”—<i>after
she has shown herself to the soul</i>.  The aim
of the best art is not slavishly to copy Nature,
but to catch and translate the dreams she suggests.</p>

  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“Stoop to earth’s service, and behold</div>
       <div class="verse">All heaven shall blossom into gold.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">We may paint as much as we like “from imagination”
or “inner consciousness,” but if Nature were
not all the time posing at our elbow, and if we
did not from time to time cast covert glances at
her as our model, our picture would never be
“inspired”; it would either harp tediously upon
ancient themes and methods, or else “advance”
into sheer chaotic incoherence.</p>

<p>And so it is that we have now come, I think, to
a time in the history and use of Alpine rockworks
when we must turn again to Nature for fresh
inspiration, for improved ideals.  The time is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
passing when Alpine conditions were held to
be sufficiently represented by the rock-fortresses
of the Alps,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
       <div class="verse">“And all the garrisons were flowers.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Of course, these garrisons are, and must always
remain, the most prominent and unique of vegetation’s
Alpine marvels, but they cannot properly be
thought to speak for all; they are, as it were, the
militant <i>éclaireurs</i> set upon the craggy heights and
watching over the peaceful hosts of their fellows
upon the fields. As is the way in all our activities,
we hug a truth a long time before becoming aware
that it is not the whole truth. Perception has small
beginnings, advance is slow, and exaggeration,
meantime, is the very breath of progress. We
ill-use a truth by over-kindness; our ecstasy forces
it to lie. We dwell extravagantly upon it until it
becomes partially false; then we move on. And
this, I find, is what has happened, and is happening,
in the case of Alpine rockworks. We have for
long dwelt alone with them as with the last word
upon the housing of Alpine plants; we have been
so absorbed in them as the whole truth, that
we have seen no need, even no possibility, for
further helpful inquiry of Nature. But the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
has now arrived when our truth is revealing itself
as only a half-truth, and, turning to glance again
at our model for a fresh advance in inspiration, we
notice in her a feature which had previously escaped
us—the fields.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>“Many people enter God’s Temple through
the doorway of Beauty”; and upon this count,
also, the fields of the Alps are of obvious import.
I venture to think that an Alpine field, with all its
concomitant “accident” and consequent variety,
will have more to say to a larger number of
men and women than will a rockwork alone; I
venture to think that a person who would not stop
longer than to patronise a rockwork, would stand
arrested and absorbed before the grass-lands and
their varied features. To the mass of mortals who
are not bespoken specialists in higher Alpines, the
meadows have no superiors in breadth, directness,
and simplicity of appeal. They are places where
the “man-in-the-street” is at once at home. They
require no special enthusiasm to make them acceptable.
Their beauty is as apparent to the “vulgar”
as it is to the elect; their charm is interesting
to all.</p>

<p>And this interest means more than mere pleasure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
more than a superficial tickling of the senses.
It entails a mint of meaning for the soul. Yes,
the soul. No gardener, no Nature-lover, need
be shy of admitting he has a soul; for it is
precisely this which makes Nature-lovers of us
all, precisely this which plays so big a part
in our admiration of the fields. “Breathes there
a man with soul so dead” who will not linger
lovingly over mountain meadows tossed or rolling
like a multi-coloured sea, with sunlight playing
amid the blues, mauves, reds, and yellows, breaking
these into endless intermediary tints; and with
butterflies seemingly in such light-hearted flight,
skipping and flitting blithely, airily, for all the
world like flowers come suddenly to sentient
life? Breathes there a man who will not find in
these meadows and their teeming gaiety “a vitalising
passion, calling to life the shrouded thoughts
and unsuspected forces of the heart”?</p>

<p>From Crocus to “Crocus”; from the first pale,
dainty flush of spring to the last full flush of
autumn; from the shy and hesitating youth of the
year to the time when all at length “is rounded
with a sleep,” these meadows are an intimate joy
and refreshment. Nature herself sets so much
store by them that when they become, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
must become, recognised components of our
Alpine gardens, it shall be said she</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
